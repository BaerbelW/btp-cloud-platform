# Getting a Global Account

SAP BTP offers two types of global accounts: Trial accounts \(completely free of charge\) and enterprise accounts. Within an enterprise account, you can use both free and paid plans.

A **global account** is the realization of a contract you made with SAP. A global account is used to manage subaccounts, members, entitlements and quotas. You receive entitlements and quotas to use platform resources per global account and then distribute the entitlements and quotas to the subaccount for actual consumption. There are two types of global accounts: enterprise accounts \(paid, unless you only use free tier service plans\) and trial accounts \(free\).
