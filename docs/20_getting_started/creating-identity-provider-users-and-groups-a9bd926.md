# Creating Identity Provider Users and Groups

You create identity provider users and groups in the Identity Authentication service.

This configuration is needed for easier developer authentication using Identity Authentication service. With the creation of identity provider groups, you can also more easily map role collections to entire user groups instead of single users, or map identity provider groups to groups in the Neo environment, if needed.
