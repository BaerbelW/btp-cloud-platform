## Procedure

1.  Get a global account.

    After youâ€™ve signed up for your enterprise account, you get an e-mail with a link to SAP BTP and the logon data as administrator for the global account.

    Log on to SAP BTP and navigate to your global account.

    > ### Note:  
    > For more information on available plans, including free tier, see [Available Plans in the Kyma Environment](../50_administration_and_ops/available-plans-in-the-kyma-environment-befe01d.md).

2.  Set up your subaccount. For more information, see [Create a Subaccount](../50_administration_and_ops/create-a-subaccount-05280a1.md).

    You can create more subaccounts to break down your account model and structure it according to your development scenario. But first it's important you understand how to navigate to your accounts using the SAP BTP cockpit.

    You can also download and use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to create new subaccounts. See [Download and Start Using the btp CLI Client](../50_administration_and_ops/download-and-start-using-the-btp-cli-client-8a8f17f.md) and [Working with Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts Using the btp CLI](../50_administration_and_ops/working-with-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts-using-the-btp-cli-85a683e.md).

3.  Create your Kyma environment. For more information, see [Create the Kyma Environment Instance](../50_administration_and_ops/create-the-kyma-environment-instance-09dd313.md).

4.  Configure your Kyma environment.

    Now that you've set up your account model, it's time to think about member management. You can add members at different levels:

    -   For Kyma-specific role assignment, see [Assign Roles in the Kyma Environment](../50_administration_and_ops/assign-roles-in-the-kyma-environment-148ae38.md).

    -   To learn more about how user roles are assigned in SAP BTP, have a look at [User and Member Management](../10_concepts/user-and-member-management-cc1c676.md).


5.  Develop your applications and extend SAP solutions.
