# RFC Communication via Destination Service

Create an RFC destination and use the *CALL FUNCTION ... DESTINATION* statement to enable RFC communication from SAP BTP, ABAP environment.

Alternatively, you can use proxies for RFC communication. For more information, see [Generating Proxies for Remote Function Call \(RFC\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/32812d950d3848359ce391dae477f201.html)
