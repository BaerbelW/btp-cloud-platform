# Managing SAML 2.0 Identity Provider

If you want to use assertion attributes, set up SAML trust to configure the SAML identity providers \(IDP\) for runtime of the Cloud Foundry environment. You must perform this step if you want your applications to use SAML assertions as the logon authentication method.

The configuration consists of the following tasks:

-   Add a new SAML identity provider \(IDP\)
-   Modify the assertion attributes in the details of an existing SAML identity provider \(IDP\)
-   Manage role collections based on SAML assertions
