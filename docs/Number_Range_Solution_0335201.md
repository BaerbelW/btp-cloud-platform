# Number Range Solution

Many business applications require unique numbers, for example, to complete the keys of data records. In order to get numbers from an interval, a number range object must be defined which can contain different properties. In addition, intervals containing the numbers, must be assigned to the number range object. Numbers can be generated from existing number range intervals.

> ### Note:  
> Creation, change, and deletion of number range objects and intervals require developer role authorization. Changes to objects and intervals can only be performed in the same software layer.
