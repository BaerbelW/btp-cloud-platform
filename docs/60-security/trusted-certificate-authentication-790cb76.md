# Trusted Certificate Authentication

All components of SAP BTP rely on a list of trusted Certificate Authorities \(CAs\), which differ depending on the runtimes used.



For your scenarios with SAP BTP, be aware of this list of CAs to ensure that you can provide trusted certificates that are signed by a trusted CA.

A list of all root CAs approved by SAP Global Security is available in SAP Note [2801396](https://me.sap.com/notes/2801396) \(SAP Global Trust List\).
