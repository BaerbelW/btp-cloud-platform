# Limitations on Bindings and Service Keys

To preserve the stability of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service, we allow a maximum of 1000 bindings and service keys in total per service instance. The service rejects attempts to add more bindings or service keys.

[Service Instance Secrets](../50-administration-and-ops/service-instance-secrets-5578ec4.md "When an application consumes a service instance of the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service (XSUAA), the application identifies itself to the service instance with a client ID and a secret. The client ID and secret are the credentials with which an application authenticates itself to the service instance.")
