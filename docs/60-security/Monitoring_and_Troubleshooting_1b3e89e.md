# Monitoring and Troubleshooting

This section provides information on troubleshooting-related activities for the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service in the Cloud Foundry environment.



> ### Tip:  
> We also recommend that you regularly check the SAP Notes and Knowledge Base for component `BC-CP-CF-SEC-IAM` in the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/home.html). These contain information about program corrections and provide additional information.
> 
> To help you troubleshoot your issue, we also recommend increasing the log verbosity of your application and application router. We provide a [script](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/troubleshooting/logcollector) to help you. If for some reason you can't use this script, increase the log verbosity manually, see related link.

Our troubleshooting information can be found in our Guided Answers [Troubleshooting for the SAP Authorization and Trust Management service in the Cloud Foundry environment](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/2212/actions/28290). Guided Answers are a specialized format to guide you step by step through troubleshooting topics. Check the individual troubleshooting topics for your error message. If you can't find your problem, create an incident in the component `BC-CP-CF-SEC-IAM`. For more information, see the related link.
