# Consumer Access



To access your provider's SaaS application for the first time, you, as consumer, need to go through an onboarding process. Here's how:

1.  Open the URL your provider has sent you to get access to their SaaS application.
2.  On the initial administrator onboarding screen, you can see your email address, subdomain and subaccount id. Click *Onboard User* to start the onboarding process. This might take a few minutes. Once the process is finished, you will be redirected to the system. This onboarding process only needs to be done once.
3.  From now on, you can access the SaaS application via your consumer-specific URL.
