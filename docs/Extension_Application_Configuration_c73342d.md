# Extension Application Configuration

Use this procedure to configure the authentication flow between the extension application and the SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.

When configuring the extension application and you have a subaccount in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment, you have to set up the connectivity from the subaccount to the SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant. To do that, you can use different authentication methods: Basic, Client Certificate, or SAML Bearer Assertion.
