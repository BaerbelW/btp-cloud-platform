# Extending SAP Solutions Using Manual Configurations

If your scenario requires a configuration setup that is not included in the automated extension configurations, you can optionally configure the integration between SAP BTP and your SAP solution manually.

> ### Note:  
> Use the manual configuration process only if your scenario is not included in the automated configurations with SAP BTP. See[Extending SAP Solutions Using Automated Configurations](extending-sap-solutions-using-automated-configurations-346864d.md)

If you configure the integration between SAP BTP and your SAP solution manually, you will not be able to benefit from any of the automations provided in the automated configurations.

## Process Flow

When configuring the integration between the cloud platform and an SAP solution manually, you need to perform the following tasks:

1.  Configure the extension subaccount. To do so, you configure the trust between the extended SAP solution and the cloud platform.

2.  Install and configure the extension application.
