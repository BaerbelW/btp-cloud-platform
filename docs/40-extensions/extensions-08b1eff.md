# Extensions

The extension capabilities of SAP Business Technology Platform \(SAP BTP\) enables developers to implement loosely coupled extension applications securely, thus implementing additional workflows or modules on top of the existing SAP cloud solution they already have.

## Overview

All standard SAP solutions are offered with customizing capabilities. Additionally, customers often have their own requirements for innovative or industry-specific extensions and the extension capabilities of SAP BTP can help them build, deploy, and operate their new functionality.

You can extend standard SAP solutions without disrupting their performance and core processes. When building extension applications, you can also benefit from the automation of the integration between the cloud platform and the extended SAP solutions.

You have the following options to extend your SAP solution:

-   Extensions with automated configurations in the Cloud Foundry environment: applicable for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Marketing Cloud, and SAP SuccessFactors.

-   Extensions with automated configurations in the Kyma environment: applicable for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Marketing Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud for Customer, SAP Commerce Cloud, and SAP Field Service Management.

-   Extensions with manual configurations in the Cloud Foundry environment: applicable for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP Cloud for Customer.




### Extensions with Automated Configurations

The extension capabilities of SAP BTP provide a standard way for extending SAP solutions and developing event-driven extensions and applications. This framework includes:

-   Simplified, standardized and unified extensibility and configuration for the SAP solutions.

-   Central catalog per customer for all connected SAP systems where data such as APIs, events, credentials and other is stored. You can benefit from business services and actionable events across end-to-end business processes.


If you have to group the systems of different SAP solutions in the same business case, you can set up the connectivity between all these systems and a global account in SAP BTP in a single formation in the SAP BTP cockpit. See [Including Systems in a Formation](including-systems-in-a-formation-68b04fa.md).

The following SAP solutions currently support the automated configurations:

-   SAP S/4HANA Cloud

-   SAP Marketing Cloud

-   SAP SuccessFactors

-   SAP Cloud for Customer

-   SAP Commerce Cloud

-   SAP Field Service Management




### Extensions with Manual Configurations

If the automated integration is not supported for your scenario, you can configure the integration manually. Using manual configurations, you can extend the following SAP solutions on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment:

-   SAP S/4HANA Cloud

-   SAP SuccessFactors

-   SAP Cloud for Customer
