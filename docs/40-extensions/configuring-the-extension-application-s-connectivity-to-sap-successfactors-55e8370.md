## Using OAuth Client with SAML Bearer Assertion Authentication

To be able to make calls to the SAP SuccessFactors OData APIs with user propagation, you need to create a destination with SAML Bearer Assertion authentication in the SAP BTP cockpit on a subaccount level. You also need to create an OAuth client in the SAP SuccessFactors system.

See [Using OAuth Client with SAML Bearer Assertion Authentication](using-oauth-client-with-saml-bearer-assertion-authentication-b5e0cd1.md#loiob5e0cd1b4f0f4a8c93f886d16d1bd308).

## Using Mutual Transport Layer Security Protocol

You can also use the mutual transport layer security \(mTLS\) when configuring the extension application's connectivity to SAP SuccessFactors.

See [Using Mutual Transport Layer Security \(mTLS\)](using-mutual-transport-layer-security-mtls-ca4b9ab.md#loioca4b9ab3d0cb46ed8055388e125126a2).
