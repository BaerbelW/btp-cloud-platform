## Prerequisites:

As a service provider, you need to fulfill the following prerequisites.

-   Youâ€™ve been registered by SAP, have your own global account and Cloud Foundry-enabled production subaccount with at least one space.

-   In your provider subaccount, the*Landscape Portal* subscription has been created.

-   The Cloud Foundry role "Space Developer" is assigned to your S-user.


Instead of transporting software components \(via gCTS\) for software delivery, software components can be contained into add-on products for a more sophisticated lifecycle management process. These add-on products are built and published with the ABAP Environment Pipeline. For more information see [Build and Publish Add-on Products on SAP BTP ABAP Environment](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/).
