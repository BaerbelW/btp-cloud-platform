# Build



> ### gCTS:  
> If you use gCTS instead of add-ons for delivering software components into production systems, the add-on build is not required.

As a Jenkins administrator, you have to trigger the add-on build process and execute it in the *03 Build/Assemble* subaccount. An assembly system is created in the *03 Build/Assemble* subaccount. The process is automated using the add-on build pipeline and the existing CI/CD server.

As an add-on admin, you define the add-on product information in the add-on descriptor file. Afterwards, you register the add-on product and global production account with SAP.

During the build process, each of the software components is composed and packaged to be delivered by the AAKaaS. To ensure that the add-on provisioning works correctly, you have to set up an installation test system, in which the assembled add-on is installed.

Once the build and test installation have been completed successfully, an add-on administrator has to confirm the release decision. Now, the add-on is technically available for deployment to the ABAP environment .

# Add-On Build



The following section explains how to build the initial version of the add-on product. The result is a delivery of type AOI \(Add-on Installation\) for the initial release 1.0.0 of both the software component and the add-on product.

**Set up a CI server and pipeline for the add-on build**

For the add-on build process, you must use a CI server and pipeline to automate this process.

-   **Add technical platform user to *03 Build/Assemble* space**

    For the add-on assembly, an assembly system in the *03 Build/Assemble* space is created in the global development account.

    To trigger the gCTS import in the assembly system, communication scenario `SAP_COM_0510` is used. See [Test Integration \(SAP\_COM\_0510\)](Test_Integration_(SAP_COM_0510)_b04a9ae.md).

    To trigger the build process in the assembly system, communication scenario `SAP_COM_0582` is used. See [Software Assembly Integration \(SAP\_COM\_0582\)](Software_Assembly_Integration_(SAP_COM_0582)_26b8df5.md).

    The credentials for an instance of these scenarios are retrieved by creating a service key in the system.

    To do so, assign a technical platform user to the global development account as an administrator and as a space developer in the build/assemble space. Later, this user’s credentials are stored in the Jenkins credentials.

-   **Add technical platform user to *04 Build/Test* space**

    For the add-on installation test, a test system in the *04 Build/Test* space is created in the global production account.

    To do so, assign a technical platform user to the global production account as an administrator and as a space developer in the build/test space. Later, this user’s credentials are stored in the Jenkins credentials. See [Creating New Space Members and Assigning Space Developer Roles to Them](Creating_New_Space_Members_and_Assigning_Space_Developer_Roles_to_Them_967fc4e.md).

-   **Configure pipeline**

    As a DevOps engineer, create the pipeline definition Jenkins file and the configuration file `.pipeline/config.yml` in the Git repository.


After that, as a Jenkins administrator, create a pipeline pointing to the Jenkins file in the Jenkins server. See [Build and Publish Add-on Products on SAP BTP, ABAP Environment](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/) and [ABAP Platform CI/CD Samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-ci-cd-samples/tree/addon-build) for more information and an example.

**Create a technical communication user for access to AAKaaS**

As part of the add-on build process, the Add-on Assembly Kit is used. With AAKaaS, the on-premise tooling is now available as a cloud service that is used by the build pipeline.

To access the service that is offered via SAP Support Launchpad, a technical communication user is used. See [2532813](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2532813).

In the *Support User Management* app in SAP ONE Support Launchpad, as an S-user, request a new technical communication user. After the technical communication user has been generated, activate the user.

> ### Note:  
> To create technical communication users in SAP Support Launchpad, you have to assign the user administratorauthorization/function to the logged-on user.

Finally, as a Jenkins administrator, add the credentials of the technical communication user to the Jenkins Credentials store.

See SAP note [2174416](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2174416) for more information on how to create and activate technical communication users.

> ### Note:  
> Make sure that this technical communication user is assigned to the customer number under which the ABAP environment tenants are licensed and for which the development namespace was reserved.

**Register add-on product/global production account**

The registration of a new add-on product is a manual step. Your add-on product should only be installed in ABAP systems within your global production account. Therefore, the add-on product name and global production account need to be registered with SAP.

As an add-on admin, create an incident using component `BC-CP-ABA`, and provide the following information:

-   Add-on product name = *addonProduct* in `addon.yml` file, e.g. /NAMESPACE/NAME

-   Global production account ID = *Account ID* in section *Global Account Info* on the overview page of your global account, e.g. 151b5fdc-58c1-4a55-95e1-467df2134c5f \(Feature Set A\) or *Global Account Info* on the *Usage Analytics* page of your global account \(Feature Set B\).


This step can be triggered by you or by SAP partner management \(governance process to be negotiated\). As a response to the service request, SAP creates a configuration for the requested add-on product so that the add-on product can be installed in the global account.

# Build Your First Add-On Version

**Create maintenance branch**

> ### Recommendation:  
> For each release and support package level, as an add-on admin, create a maintenance branch that is used for development of bug fixes and maintenance deliveries. See [Versioning and Branches](Concepts_9482e7e.md#loio8c087bca40584f9b899282b4ec515753).

In the test system, create branch ***v1.0.0*** that is based on the main branch.

**Configure addon.yml file**

As add-on admin user, create the `addon.yml` file in the Git repository used for the add-on build pipeline configuration. This file includes metadata of the add-on product that is being built, such as versioning information and the included software component versions.

Maintain a metadata file that defines the add-on version and store it in a Git repository \(`addon.yml`\).

```
---
addonProduct: /NAMESPC/PRODUCTX
addonVersion: 1.2.0
repositories:
  - name: /NAMESPC/COMPONENTA
    branch: v1.2.0
    version: 1.2.0
    commitID: 7d4516e9
  - name: /NAMESPC/COMPONENTB
    branch: v2.0.0
    version: 2.0.0
    commitID: 9f102ffb

```

`addonProduct` must include the reserved development namespace.

`addonVersion` starts with version 1.0.0 for the initial delivery.

The software components, defined in repositories, include the name, branch, and software component version to be used for the add-on build.

> ### Note:  
> To learn how software lifecycle management in the ABAP environment works with software components, see [Basic Concepts and Terms](Basic_Concepts_and_Terms_fb3a076.md).

> ### Note:  
> For the software components in the repositories section of the `addon.yml` file, you have to maintain the following details:
> 
> -   name = name of software component including namespace
> -   branch = name of active maintenance branch, e.g. v1.2.0, can be retrieved from the *Manage Software Components* app
> -   version = software component version
> -   commitID = short commit ID of changes to be included, can be retrieved from commit history in the *Manage Software Components* app

> ### Tip:  
> For in-depth information about versioning and branches, check out [Versioning and Branches](Concepts_9482e7e.md#loio8c087bca40584f9b899282b4ec515753).

**Trigger add-on product build**

As an add-on administrator, trigger the execution of the configured ABAP environment pipeline for the add-on build.

![](images/Pipeline_add-on_build_d36cfe1.png)

**Trigger add-on product test**

The integration tests stage of the ABAP environment pipeline creates the add-on installation test system ATI. After the system and the add-on have been provisioned successfully, a provisioning mail is sent to the system administrator and the pipeline stage can be confirmed by the add-on administrator.

**Trigger add-on product release**

Finally, the add-on product is published after the release decision is confirmed in the *Confirm* stage by the add-on administrator.

After a successful build, all ABAP systems used are deprovisioned.

> ### Tip:  
> For in-depth information about the ABAP environment pipeline, check out [ABAP Environment Pipeline](Concepts_9482e7e.md#loio2398b874f7c5445db188b780ff0cef89).

The add-on is now technically available for deployment to the ABAP environment.

> ### Note:  
> If you need support or experience issues during the add-on build, please refer to [Troubleshooting](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#troubleshooting).

> ### gCTS:  
> Using gCTS, the add-on build process is redundant. Instead, you have to import the software component using the *Manage Software Components* app. For the initial import of the software component, clone the software component and pull its main branch into the development and test system. In the production system, clone the software component for an initial import. Once it is pulled on the main branch, create a maintenance branch and check it out.
