# Maintain Communication Users

You can use this app to create and edit communication users. Communication users are used by solutions to authenticate themselves to be able to post data.



With this app you can manage communication users for different integration scenarios with other solutions. A communication user enables the integration with other solutions. To be able to post data, the solutions have to authenticate themselves with the user and password you create here. The communication users are assigned to the communication system you want to use.
