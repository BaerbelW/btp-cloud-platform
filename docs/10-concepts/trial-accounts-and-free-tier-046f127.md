## Trial Account or Free Tier Offering: When to Use Which?

Before setting up your account, you need to decide which free offering for SAP BTP is suitable for your needs:

-   **Pay-As-You-Go or CPEA accounts with free tier service plans** are open to customers, partners, and individual developers and let you try out SAP BTP for free without time limits. These account types enable you to test your scenarios with an easy path to productive use and allow you to upgrade to paid service plans. These accounts also allow you to store data long-term and move projects to production easily. You also get access to our community, including free technical resources such as tutorials and blog posts. For more information, see [Enterprise Accounts](enterprise-accounts-171511c.md) and [Using Free Service Plans](using-free-service-plans-524e108.md).

    You can self-register for an enterprise account with free tier service plans. For more information, see [Get an Account on SAP BTP to Try Out Free Tier Service Plans](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html).

-   A **trial account** lets you try out SAP BTP for free for 365 days. Access is open to everyone. Trial accounts are intended for personal exploration, and not for production use or team development. They allow restricted use of the platform resources and services.

    You can self-register for a trial account. For more information, see [Get a Free Trial Account](../20-getting-started/getting-a-global-account-d61c281.md#loio42e7e54590424e65969fced1acd47694).
