# Enterprise Accounts

Enterprise accounts are associated with SAP customer or partner contracts and contain their purchased entitlements to platform resources and services.

SAP BTP provides different types of global accounts, **enterprise** and **trial**. The type you choose determines pricing, conditions of use, resources, available services, and hosts.

It depends on your use case whether you choose a free trial account or a paid enterprise account. You may want to start out with an SAP BTP trial account that also gives you access to our community, including free technical resources such as tutorials and blog posts. If you plan to use your global account in productive mode, you must purchase a paid enterprise account. It is important that you are aware of these differences when you are planning and setting up your account model. For more information, see [Trial Accounts](Trial_Accounts_046f127.md).

An **enterprise account** is usually associated with one SAP customer or partner and contains their purchased entitlements to platform resources and services. It groups together different subaccounts that an administrator makes available to users for deploying applications. Administrators can assign the available quotas to the different subaccounts and move it between subaccounts that belong to the same enterprise account.

## EU Access

Some customer contracts include EU Access, which restricts processing of personal data to EEA/Switzerland. If the global account is marked with EU Access, the actual EU Access compliance status of subaccounts will be displayed during creation of subaccounts.

> ### Note:  
> If you need a subaccount with EU Access, make sure to select a provider and region, where EU Access is available. For more information, see [Regions](Regions_350356d.md#loio350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e)
> 
> For some services, EU Access is generally not available, not even if the provider and region support EU Access.
