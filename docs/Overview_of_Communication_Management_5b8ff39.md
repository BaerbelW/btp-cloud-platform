# Overview of Communication Management

The following information helps you understand the basic principles of communication management when integrating your system or solution with other systems to enable data exchange in your ABAP environment.

Communication in the ABAP environment is based on a communication scenario \(design time\), which describes the meta data needed to set up the communication arrangement \(runtime\) in your system.
