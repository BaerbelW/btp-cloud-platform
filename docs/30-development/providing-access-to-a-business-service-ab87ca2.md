# Providing Access to a Business Service

For business and communication users, you must provide access to a newly created service because access isnâ€™t automatically available.

Depending on whether you implement a business service that should be used by business users or that should be accessed using a communication user, you must proceed differently. For example, you create different identity and access management artifacts in ABAP Development Tools.

In this documentation, you can find a step-by-step instruction of how to proceed for business users and for communication users.
