# Develop Common Capabilities

The guides in this section focus on specific development tasks common to a business configuration application. Whether or not you want to follow these guidelines depends on your initial situation and the desired result of your development.

> ### Note:  
> The [Business Configuration Maintenance Object wizard](generating-a-business-configuration-maintenance-object-with-the-generate-abap-repository-047e01c.md) takes these concepts into account. You can therefore use the wizard to generate an executable example which illustrates the implementation of these concepts.
