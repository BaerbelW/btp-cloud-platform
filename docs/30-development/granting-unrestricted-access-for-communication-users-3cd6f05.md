# Granting \(Unrestricted\) Access for Communication Users

In this scenario, you get information about how to grant unrestricted access for communication users with a few steps.

In this scenario, to provide access to the business service, you must create a communication scenario. Administrators then create a communication arrangement based on this communication scenario. Note that all objects that need to be created are highlighted in dark blue in the graphic.

This scenario requires only a few steps to grant authorizations, and it's the minimum that you must do to make your service available to communication users. However, with this scenario, you always grant unrestricted write **and** read access. If you want to fine-tune the authorizations in more detail, check the scenario *Granting Access Based on Activities*.
