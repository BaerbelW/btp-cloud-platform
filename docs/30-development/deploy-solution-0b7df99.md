# Deploy Solution



You’ve created a solution \(see [Create Solution](create-solution-aca34fa.md)\) and specified the deployment configurations \(see [Create Deployment Configuration](create-deployment-configuration-58b90ec.md)\). Now you’re ready to deploy your solution to your provider subaccount. Here’s how that’s done.

1.  Log in to the *Landscape Portal*.

2.  Under *Solution*, click on the *Maintain Solution* tile to open the app.

3.  Select a solution from the list to go to its object page.

4.  Under *Deployment Configurations*, select a deployment configuration and click the *Deploy* button on the right. The deployment is now triggered and you will be forwarded to the *Deployment Status* view.

5.  You can monitor the pipeline status for your deployment.


> ### Note:  
> Note that you can only deploy one solution per space.
