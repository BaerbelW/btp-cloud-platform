# Updating Service Instances

Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface to update service instances:

-   [Update Service Instances Using the SAP BTP Cockpit or Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](update-service-instances-using-the-sap-btp-cockpit-or-cloud-foundry-command-line-interfac-54fe2e7.md)


You can also update service instances inside a multitarget application if the service broker supports updates. Change the deployment descriptor file or a configuration file for a service instance inside your multitarget application and deploy your application to trigger an update of the respective service instance.
