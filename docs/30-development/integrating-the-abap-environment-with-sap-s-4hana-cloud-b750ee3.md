## Example Scenario Used in This Documentation

As an example scenario in this documentation, we'll assume that developers want to use a service that creates, reads, updates, and deletes master data related to business partners, suppliers, and customers in an SAP S/4HANA system. To achieve this, the developer makes an outbound service call from SAP Business Technology Platform to this SAP S/4HANA Cloud service, using this service to create a business partner.
