## Procedure

1.  Implement the business logic. You need to create a class which implements certain interfaces so that it is usable in an application job. For more information, see [Implementing the Business Logic](../50-administration-and-ops/Implementing_the_Business_Logic_99dcde1.md).

2.  Define the Job Catalog Entry. With a method of a certain framework class, you create a Job Catalog Entry which refers to the class of step 1. For more information, see [Creating the Job Catalog Entry](../50-administration-and-ops/Creating_the_Job_Catalog_Entry_1cff59e.md).

3.  Define the Job Template. With another method of the framework class, you create a Job Template which refers to the Job Catalog Entry of step 2. For more information, see [Creating the Job Template](../50-administration-and-ops/Creating_the_Job_Template_1f04ad2.md).
