# Deploy Business Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment

When an application for the Cloud Foundry environment resides in a folder on your local machine, you can deploy it and start it by executing the command line interface \(CLI\) command `push`. To deploy business applications bundled in a multitarget application archive, you have to use the command `deploy-mta`.

-   For more information about developing and deploying applications in the Cloud Foundry environment, see [http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html).
-   For more information developing Multitarget Applications, see [Multitarget Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](multitarget-applications-in-the-cloud-foundry-environment-d04fc0e.md). See [Multitarget Application Commands for the Cloud Foundry Environment](../50-administration-and-ops/multitarget-application-commands-for-the-cloud-foundry-environment-65ddb1b.md) for information about MTA deployment.
