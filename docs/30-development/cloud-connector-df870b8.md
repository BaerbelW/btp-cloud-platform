# Cloud Connector

The Cloud Connector serves as a link between SAP BTP applications and on-premise systems. In the Cloud Connector, the subaccount of the ABAP system is connected so that the Cloud Connector can be used within a communication system or destination in the subaccount.

It provides an easy setup with a clear configuration of the systems that are exposed to SAP BTP.
