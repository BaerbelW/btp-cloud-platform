# Identity and Access Management

The *Identity and Access Management*apps secure access to the solution for business users.

The main elements of IAM are business catalogs, business roles, and business users. Access to business apps is controlled by role-based authorization management. That means you assign roles to users and these roles provide access to certain business tasks. You can also assign users to roles in the *Maintain Business Roles* app. The main purpose of the app, however, is to create and adapt business roles. You create business roles by combining pre-defined business catalogs which contain the actual authorizations that allow users to access apps for a specific business area.

## IAM For Our Scenario

By creating an IAM app, the S\_Start authorization is automatically assigned to the query exposed via 'InA' service. This basic authorization is mandatory for users to work with their services. A business catalog needs to be created and added to the developer role using the *Maintain Business Roles* app. This will grant all employees with the same role access to your business catalog.
