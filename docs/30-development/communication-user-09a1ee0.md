# Communication User

A communication user is a specific type of technical user that is assigned to a communication system. The user can be assigned a password or X.509 certificate.

The administrator creates the communication user in the SAP Fiori launchpad. Note that the communication user is not transported between systems but created locally. If there are multiple systems, the technical users and their credentials can vary for each system. To maintain a communication user, business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_COM` needs to be assigned to the user that wants to perform changes.
