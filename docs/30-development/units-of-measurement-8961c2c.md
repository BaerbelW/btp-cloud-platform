# Units of Measurement

Many business applications use units of measurement in their business processes. To standardize these processes, you need a central maintenance of units and related dimensions. Beside that, there's a business need for conversion between different units.

We provide a subset of common standardized units, dimensions, and ISO codes for use as predelivered content. In addition, you need to define customer-owned units and dimensions in customer applications.

## How are Units and Dimensions Linked?

Units are related to a dimension. In each dimension, a unit is defined as an SI unit \(International System of Units\). This is the basis for the conversion from one unit to another.
