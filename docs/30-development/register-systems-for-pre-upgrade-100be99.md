# Register Systems for Pre-Upgrade

You have an upgrade planned for your systems. The *Register Systems for Pre-Upgrade* app allows you to select specific test- or development systems for an early upgrade: These systems will be upgraded two weeks before the official roll-out, giving you ample time to test your solution prior to the actual upgrade.
