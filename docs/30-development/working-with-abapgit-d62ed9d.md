# Working with abapGit

abapGit is an open source developed Git client for the ABAP server to import and export ABAP objects between ABAP systems.

With abapGit, you can push your ABAP objects either from an on-premise system or an ABAP environment system to a Git repository or import them into a target system. See [Use abapGit to Transfer Your On-Premise ABAP Source Code to the Cloud](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-abapgit.html) and [Push Your ABAP Source Code from SAP BTP, ABAP Environment to a GitHub Repository Using abapGit](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-abapgit-transfer.html).

> ### Note:  
> The official SAP-supported version of abapGit is delivered with your ABAP environment system. To use abapGit in an on-premise system, you have to install the community version of abapGit, which is called zabapGit. This version is not officially supported by SAP and the usage of zabapGit is at your own risk. You can find the community version of abapGit on GitHub.
