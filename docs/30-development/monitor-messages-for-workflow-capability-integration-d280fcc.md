## Context

With the *Message Dashboard* or *Message Monitoring Overview*, you can monitor and administrate the SAP Business Workflow background processing. You can manually trigger or cancel monitored background tasks that have issues.

AIF messages are deleted after a retention time, which can be configured in AIF customizing. The default value for all workflow-relevant namespaces and interfaces is set to 7 days.
