# API to Manage Git Repositories

You can use the `MANAGE_GIT_REPOSITORY` API to pull or clone Git repositories to ABAP environment systems and to create and checkout branches. The `MANAGE_GIT_REPOSITORY` API belongs to the Communication Scenario SAP\_COM\_0510.

> ### Note:  
> In ABAP environment, Git repositories are wrapped in software components. These are currently managed in the **Manage Software Components** app. The technical parameter `sc_name` used in this API needs to be the name of the Git repository on the ABAP environment system â€“ the name of the software component.

> ### Note:  
> It is currently not possible to execute/trigger multiple actions \(clones/pulls/deletes\) in parallel on one system, regardless of the fact that the calls run asynchronously.
