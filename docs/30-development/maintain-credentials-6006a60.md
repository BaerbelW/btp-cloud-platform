# Maintain Credentials

Before you configure and deploy your SaaS solution, you need to maintain the necessary credentials for the user that will be used in the deployment. You have already created a technical user that is available in SAP ID service, and have assigned it the Space Developer role in the Cloud Foundry space that you want to deploy your SaaS solution to. Now you need to add this user in the *Maintain Solution* app.

1.  Log in to the *Landscape Portal* from your provider subaccount.

2.  Under *Solution*, click on the *Maintain Solution* tile to open the app.

3.  Switch to the tab *Credentials*.

4.  In the *Credentials* table, you can view all of your existing credentials. To edit an existing credential, select it and click the *Edit* button. To create a new user, click the *Create* button and fill in the required information.

    *Save* your changes.

5.  \(Optional\) To delete an existing credential, select it and click the *Delete* button.


Now that you've added your technical user, you are ready to create your solution, see [Create Solution](create-solution-aca34fa.md).
