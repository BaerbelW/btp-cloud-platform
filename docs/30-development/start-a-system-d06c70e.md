# Start a System



You want to bring a system out of hibernation and start it again.

Here's how it's done.

1.  Log into the *Landscape Portal* from your provider subaccount.
2.  In the *Systems* section, click on the*Manage System Hibernation* tile to open the app.
3.  On the left side, under *Systems*, you can see a list of all your systems, as well as their current status \(*Live* or *Stopped*\). *Live* systems are currently active, *Stopped* systems are in hibernation. You can also see if a system is currently in the process of *Stopping* or *Starting*.
4.  Select one or more systems with status *Stopped* that you want to bring out of hibernation, then click the *Start* button at the top.

    > ### Note:  
    > The button will only be enabled if all selected systems can be started.

5.  A pop-up window will open, asking you to confirm your choice. Confirm your choice by clicking *OK*.

The selected system\(s\) will now start again.

> ### Note:  
> Note that it might take a few minutes for the system to be live again.
