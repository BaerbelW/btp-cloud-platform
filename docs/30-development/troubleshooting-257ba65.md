## *Add-on Update* button is not enabled

-   Check if you have the necessary role collection assigned to your user. This feature requires role collection “LandscapePortalAdminRoleCollection”.

-   To use this feature, an add-on product needs to be installed. Make sure the add-on product is shown in the *Software* section of the system.

-   Make sure there are no ongoing add-on update processes.

## Version number does not change after add-on update

-   If the version number does not change after an add-on update, a new add-on version might have already been installed in the system.

-   The software component version may already be installed in the system or the add-on configuration might not match the required settings. Please see [Add-on descriptor file.](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#add-on-descriptor-file)
