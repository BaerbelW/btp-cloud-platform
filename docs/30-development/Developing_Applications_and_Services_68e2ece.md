## Basic Considerations

At the outset of every development project stand questions about the goal you want to achieve, which skills, tools, and programming languages are required, and how the finished application or service is deployed and maintained. This topic provides an overview of the programming models, development languages, tools, and services you can leverage in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment to help you address those questions.

## SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) is the recommended framework for application and service development in the Cloud Foundry environment. To learn more, see [Developing with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](Developing_with_the_SAP_Cloud_Application_Programming_Model_00823f9.md).

## Services in the Cloud Foundry Environment

In a PaaS environment, external dependencies such as databases, messaging systems, and file systems are services. To use a service, you need to create a service instance and bind it to your application, using either the cockpit or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface \(CF CLI\). To learn more, see [Using Services in the Cloud Foundry Environment](Using_Services_in_the_Cloud_Foundry_Environment_f22029f.md).

## Development Languages

Find information and tutorials for the main development languages supported in the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment: Java, Node.js, and Python. See [Development Languages](Development_Languages_2d0ff22.md).

## Multitenant Applications

If you want to make your applications and services available for use to other SAP BTP users, you can design them as multitenant applications. This allows consumers, who are called tenants in this scenario, to access what you've created through dedicated URLs. For more information, see [Developing Multitenant Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](Developing_Multitenant_Applications_in_the_Cloud_Foundry_Environment_5e8a2b7.md).
