> ### Note:  
> Some of the steps are only relevant if your developers are supposed to expose business services using the OAuth 2.0 authentication method. If you only want to use basic authentication \(user ID and password\), some of the steps for setting up a trust relationship are not necessary.
> 
> Such optional steps are indicated. Note that if you want to use the example service used in this documentation, you must follow all steps.
