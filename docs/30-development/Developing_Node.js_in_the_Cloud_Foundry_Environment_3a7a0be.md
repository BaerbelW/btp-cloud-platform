# Developing Node.js in the Cloud Foundry Environment

This section offers selected information for Node.js development on the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment and references to more detailed sources.



In this section about Node.js development, you get information about the buildpack supported by SAP and about the Node.js packages, and how you consume them in your application.

There is also a small tutorial with an introduction to securing your application, and some tips and tricks for developing and running Node.js applications on the Cloud Foundry environment.

## Node.js Buildpack

 SAP BTP uses the standard Node.js buildpack provided by Cloud Foundry to deploy Node.js applications.

To get familiar with the buildpack and how to deploy applications with it, take a look at the [Cloud Foundry Node.js Buildpack documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/index.html).

## SAP Node.js Packages

You can download and consume SAP developed Node.js packages via the SAP NPM Registry. There is an overview of Node.js packages developed by SAP, what they are meant for, and where they are included in the SAP HANA Developer Guide for XS Advanced Model. As the Node.js packages used for development in the Cloud Foundry are similar or the same, as those in SAP HANA XS advanced, the links guide you to the SAP HANA Developer Guide for XS Advanced Model.
