# Build



> ### gCTS Delivery:  
> If you use gCTS instead of add-ons for delivering software components into production systems, the add-on build is not required.
> 
> Instead, you have to import the software component using the *Manage Software Components* app. For the initial import of the software component, clone the software component and pull its main branch into the development and test system.
> 
> Once it is pulled on the main branch, create a maintenance branch with version v1.0.0, for example.
> 
> See [Delivery via Add-On or gCTS](delivery-via-add-on-or-gcts-438d7eb.md#loio438d7ebfdc4a41de82dcdb156f01857e).

> ### Tip:  
> For in-depth information about the ABAP environment pipeline used for add-on build, check out [ABAP Environment Pipeline](concepts-9482e7e.md#loio2398b874f7c5445db188b780ff0cef89).

As a Jenkins administrator, you have to trigger the add-on build process. An assembly system is created in the *03 Build/Assemble* subaccount. The process is automated using the add-on build pipeline and the existing CI/CD server.

As an add-on admin, you define the add-on product information in the add-on descriptor file. Afterwards, you register the add-on product and global accounts for development/production with SAP.

During the build process, each of the software components is composed and packaged to be delivered by the AAKaaS. To ensure that the add-on provisioning works correctly, you have to set up an installation test system, in which the assembled add-on is installed.

Once the build and test installation have been completed successfully, an add-on administrator has to confirm the release decision. Now, the add-on is technically available for deployment to the ABAP environment.

## Prerequisites

-   For the add-on build, you have to set up a Jenkins CI/CD server that is provisioned using the Cx server and you need an S-user in SAP One Support Launchpad with user management authorization. See [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Cx Server](https://www.project-piper.io/infrastructure/overview/#cx-server-recommended), and SAP note [1271482](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1271482).
-   To build the first add-on version, you have to configure the add-on build pipeline. See [Build and Publish Add-on Products on SAP BTP, ABAP Environment](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/).

## Set Up Add-On Build



The following section explains how to build the initial version of the add-on product. The result is a delivery of type AOI \(Add-on Installation\) for the initial release 1.0.0 of both the software component and the add-on product.

For the add-on build process, you must use a pipeline to automate this process.



### Add Technical Platform User to Space in Subaccount *03 Build/Assemble*

For the add-on assembly, an assembly system is created in the *03 Build/Assemble* space in the global account for development.

To trigger the gCTS import in the assembly system, communication scenario `SAP_COM_0510` is used. See [Test Integration \(SAP\_COM\_0510\)](test-integration-sap-com-0510-b04a9ae.md).

To trigger the build process in the assembly system, communication scenario `SAP_COM_0582` is used. See [Software Assembly Integration \(SAP\_COM\_0582\)](software-assembly-integration-sap-com-0582-26b8df5.md).

The credentials for an instance of these scenarios are retrieved by creating a service key in the system. See [Create a Communication Arrangement for Inbound Communication with Service Key Type Basic](create-a-communication-arrangement-for-inbound-communication-with-service-key-type-basic-1cc5a1d.md).

To do so, as an operator, assign a technical Cloud Foundry platform user as a space developer in subaccount *03 Build/Assemble*. Later, this user’s credentials are stored in the Jenkins credentials. See [Creating New Space Members and Assigning Space Developer Roles to Them](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/967fc4e2b1314cf7afc7d7043b53e566.html?version=Cloud).



### Add Technical Platform User to Space in Subaccount *04 Build/Test*

For the add-on installation test, a test system is created in the space in subaccount *04 Build/Test*, which was created earlier in the global account for development.

To do so, as an operator, assign a technical Cloud Foundry platform user as a space developer in the space in subaccount *04 Build/Test*. Later, this user’s credentials are stored in the Jenkins credentials. See [Creating New Space Members and Assigning Space Developer Roles to Them](../20-getting-started/creating-new-space-members-and-assigning-space-developer-roles-to-them-967fc4e.md).



### Create a Technical Communication User for Access to AAKaaS

As part of the add-on build process, the Add-on Assembly Kit is used. With AAKaaS, the on-premise tooling is now available as a cloud service that is used by the build pipeline.

To access the service that is offered via SAP Support Launchpad, a technical communication user is used. See SAP note [2532813](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2532813).

In the *Support User Management* app in SAP ONE Support Launchpad, as an S-user, request a new technical communication user. After the technical communication user has been generated, activate the user.

> ### Note:  
> To create technical communication users in SAP Support Launchpad, you have to assign the user administrator function to the logged on user.
> 
> Make sure that this technical communication user is assigned to the customer number under which the ABAP environment tenants are licensed and for which the development namespace was reserved.

Finally, as a Jenkins administrator, add the credentials of the technical communication user to the Jenkins Credentials store.

See SAP note [2174416](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2174416) for more information on how to create and activate technical communication users.



### Register Add-On Product for Installation in Global Accounts

The registration of a new add-on product is a manual step. Your add-on product should only be installed in ABAP systems in your global accounts for development and production. Therefore, the product needs to be created and global accounts need to be registered with SAP using Landscape Portal.

See [Register Product](register-product-dc15fb4.md).



### Configure ABAP Environment Pipeline

As a DevOps engineer, create an ABAP environment pipeline configuration for the add-on build scenario. As a Jenkins administrator, create a new pipeline in Jenkins pointing to the Jenkins file of the pipeline configuration for the add-on build scenario. See [Configuration](https://www.project-piper.io/pipelines/abapEnvironment/configuration/).

The add-on build scenario of the ABAP environment pipeline is described in detail in [Build and Publish Add-on Products on SAP BTP, ABAP Environment](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/).

## Build the First Add-On Version

**Create Maintenance Branch**

> ### Recommendation:  
> For each release and support package level, as an add-on admin, create a maintenance branch that is used for development of bug fixes and maintenance deliveries. See [Versioning and Branches](concepts-9482e7e.md#loio8c087bca40584f9b899282b4ec515753).

In test system TST, create branch `v1.0.0` that is based on the main branch.

**Configure addon.yml File**

> ### Tip:  
> Use the [Check Product Version](check-product-version-0da158a.md) app in Landscape Portal to find out which product version has already been built.

As add-on admin user, create the `addon.yml` file in the Git repository used for the add-on build pipeline configuration. This file includes metadata of the add-on product that is being built, such as versioning information and the included software component versions.

Maintain a metadata file that defines the add-on version and store it in a Git repository \(`addon.yml`\).

```
---
addonProduct: "/NAMESPC/PRODUCTX"
addonVersion: "1.2.0"
repositories:
  - name: "/NAMESPC/COMPONENTA"
    branch: "v1.2.0"
    version: "1.2.0"
    commitID: "7d4516e9"
  - name: "/NAMESPC/COMPONENTB"
    branch: "v2.0.0"
    version: "2.0.0"
    commitID: "9f102ffb"

```

`addonProduct` must include the reserved development namespace.

`addonVersion` starts with version 1.0.0 for the initial delivery.

The software components, defined in repositories, include the name, branch, and software component version to be used for the add-on build.

For the software components in the repositories section of the `addon.yml` file, you have to maintain the following details:

-   name = name of software component including namespace
-   branch = name of active maintenance branch, e.g. v1.2.0, can be retrieved from the *Manage Software Components* app
-   version = software component version
-   commitID = short commit ID of changes to be included, can be retrieved from commit history in the *Manage Software Components* app

> ### Tip:  
> For in-depth information about versioning and branches, check out [Versioning and Branches](concepts-9482e7e.md#loio8c087bca40584f9b899282b4ec515753).
> 
> To learn how software lifecycle management in the ABAP environment works with software components, see [Basic Concepts and Terms](basic-concepts-and-terms-fb3a076.md). Please follow the best practices on how to define the addon.yml file. See [Add-On Descriptor File](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#add-on-descriptor-file).

**Trigger Add-On Build Pipeline**

> ### Tip:  
> For in-depth information about the ABAP environment pipeline, see [ABAP Environment Pipeline](concepts-9482e7e.md#loio2398b874f7c5445db188b780ff0cef89).

![](images/Pipeline_add-on_build_d36cfe1.png)

As an add-on administrator, trigger the execution of the configured ABAP environment pipeline for the add-on build. During the add-on build, delivery packages corresponding to included software component versions are created. For the add-on product version, a target vector is created and published in test scope. See [Target Vector](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#target-vector).

Based on the target vector published in the build stage, the Integration Tests stage of the ABAP environment pipeline creates the add-on installation test system ATI. After the system and the add-on have been provisioned successfully, a provisioning mail is sent to the system administrator and the pipeline stage can be confirmed by the add-on administrator.

Use add-on installation test system ATI to confirm the successful add-on installation before the new add-on version is published.

You can also use add-on installation test system ATI for additional tests, similar to the steps described in [Test in the ABAP Environment SAP Fiori Launchpad](test-023cf9d.md#loio8c5b4d76a05b4bed8df01937f4d8d487). For testing in a consumer-like environment, you can create tenants of type Partner Test using the Landscape Portal application. See [Use Test Tenants](use-test-tenants-dd7d8e8.md).

> ### Note:  
> Please make sure that the add-on product version to be published is properly tested before confirming the release decision. This includes testing in SAP Fiori launchpad and the ABAP Test Cockpit. See [Test in the ABAP Environment SAP Fiori Launchpad](test-023cf9d.md#loio8c5b4d76a05b4bed8df01937f4d8d487) and [Test in the ABAP Test Cockpit](test-023cf9d.md#loiof0b71a1c959842258772c27d292c43b0).

Finally, the previously created target vector for the new add-on product version is published in production scope after the add-on administrator has confirmed the release decision in the Confirm stage.

After a successful build, all ABAP systems used are deprovisioned and the add-on is technically available for deployment to the ABAP environment.

**Check Add-on Build Result**

Use the *Check Product Version* app in Landscape Portal to check whether the product version, its components, and respective packages are ready for delivery. See [Check Product Version](check-product-version-0da158a.md).
