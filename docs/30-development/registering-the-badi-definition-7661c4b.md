# Registering the BAdI Definition



## Context

To make your BAdI available in the *Custom Logic* app, follow the steps below.



## Procedure

1.  Right-click on your BAdI definition in the enhancement spot detail screen and choose *Custom Logic*.

2.  Select *Check* to verify that your BAdI was implemented correctly. In case error messages appear, fix the root cause of the errors. Then, select *Register*.

3.  Choose a transport request and select *Finish*. Your BAdI definition has now been registered.

4.  To deregister your BAdI, right-click on the BAdI definition and select *Custom Logic*. Then, choose *Deregister*. Click *Next*, choose a transport request and select *Finish*. Now, the BAdI has been deregistered.

    > ### Note:  
    > Do not deregister a BAdI that was already shipped to customers. There could be existing implementations that are no longer visible when the BAdI is gone.
    > 
    > Remember to deregister the BAdI that is registered for *Custom Logic* first before deleting it. If you delete the BAdI without deregistering it, you'll receive an error message preventing you from saving the enhancement spot. You can go back to the last active version by closing the enhancement spot without saving.
