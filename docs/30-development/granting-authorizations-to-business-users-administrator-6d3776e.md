# Granting Authorizations to Business Users \(Administrator\)

As an administrator, create business roles to grant authorizations to business users.

After a business catalog and optionally a business role template have been created by the developer, administrators take over. They grant authorizations to business users by creating and assigning business roles. The business role needs to contain the business catalog created by the developer to get all the predefined authorizations needed for the business service. If a business role template is available, the administrator can also use the business role template to create a new business role.
