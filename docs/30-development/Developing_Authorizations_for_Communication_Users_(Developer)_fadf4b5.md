# Developing Authorizations for Communication Users \(Developer\)

After youâ€™ve protected your service against unauthorized use, you can now create the objects that are needed to grant authorizations for communication users: authorization default values and a communication scenario.

Follow the steps for editing authorization default values and for creating a communication scenario in ABAP Development Tools.

> ### Note:  
> For developing authorizations for business users, the procedure is different. For more information, see [Developing Authorizations for Business Users \(Developer\)](Developing_Authorizations_for_Business_Users_(Developer)_6466244.md).
