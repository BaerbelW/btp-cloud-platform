# Providing Business Add-Ins

You, as an SAP partner, want to provide your customers with business add-ins \(hereafter called BAdIs\) so that customers can add their own business logic to your business processes by using the *Custom Logic* app.

This document describes the steps required for releasing a BAdI that can be used by key users of the *Custom Logic* app. The following steps are required:

-   Create an enhancement spot for your BAdIs.

-   Create the BAdI definition. This includes the interface definition and filter definitions.
-   Release the BAdI definition.
-   Provide an example implementation for your BAdI.
-   Register the BAdI definition for the *Custom Logic* app.

After following these steps, your customers will be able to create BAdI implementations using the *Custom Logic* app.
