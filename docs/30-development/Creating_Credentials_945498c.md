# Creating Credentials

Create service credentials your application will use to call the service and retrieve information from it.

The application needs information necessary to connect to the service and authenticate it. The Service Catalog uses the ServiceBinding custom resource to create the Kubernetes Secret object which contains the credentials necessary to call the service.
