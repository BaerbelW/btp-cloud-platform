# Installation and Configuration of the ODBC Driver for ABAP

To be able to use an ODBC-based client to access data in the exposed CDS view entities of the ABAP environment, you must install the ODBC driver and create an ODBC data source.

Proceed as follows:

1.  Install the ODBC driver on your operating system \(see [Installing the ODBC Driver](Installing_the_ODBC_Driver_8dcb3db.md)\).

2.  Create an ODBC data source on your operating system \(see [Creating an ODBC Data Source \(Windows\)](Creating_an_ODBC_Data_Source_(Windows)_eca3915.md) or [Creating an ODBC Data Source \(Linux\)](Creating_an_ODBC_Data_Source_(Linux)_d63fc2e.md)\).
