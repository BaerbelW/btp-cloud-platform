2.  Add an IAM app name as well as a description and press *Next*.

3.  Choose a corresponding transport request and press *Finish*.

4.  Open the created IAM app and add the previously deployed Business Application Studio app as *Fiori Launchpad Descr Item ID*. Finally, press *Publish Locally*.

5.  Now assign the IAM app to a new or already existing business catalog and an according description. Press *Finish*.

6.  Complete the process by publishing the business catalog to the system. Press *Publish Locally*.






### Business Role Settings
