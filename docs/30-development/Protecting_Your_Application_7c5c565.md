# Protecting Your Application

Developers create authorization information for business users in their environment; this information is deployed in an application and made available to administrators who complete the authorization setup and assign the authorizations to business users.

## Lifecycle of Security Artifacts for Developers and Administrators

Developers store authorization information as design-time role templates in the application security descriptor file `(xs-security.json)`. Using the `xsuaa` service broker, they deploy the security information to the `xsuaa` service. The administrators view the authorization information in role templates, which they use as part of the run-time configuration. They use the role templates to build roles, which are aggregated in role collections. The role collections are then assigned, in turn, to business users.

The tasks required to set up authorization artifacts are performed by two distinct user roles: the application developer and the administrator of the Cloud Foundry environment. After the deployment of the authorization artifacts as role templates, the administrator of the application uses the role templates provided by the developers for building role collections and assigning them to business users.

> ### Note:  
> To test authorization artifacts after deployment, developers can use the role templates to build role collections and assign authorization to business users in an authorization tool based on a REST API.
