## Context

Multitenancy allows service providers to host different consumers \(tenants\) on a single shared system. But how do you, as a service provider, keep track of all your tenants and systems? This is where the *Landscape Portal* comes in. The *Landscape Portal* acts as a central tool to allow service providers to perform lifecycle management operations such as add-on updates, provisioning new consumers as new tenants, and more.

## Key Features

You can currently use the *Landscape Portal* to do the following:

-   Get an overview of your systems and tenants.

-   See which version a system software is currently on.

-   Create support users.

-   Create test tenants.

-   Perform add-on updates.

-   View the request log.

-   Create a ticket with support context.

-   Restore tenants that are still in retention time.


> ### Note:  
> Keep in mind that a consumer subscription-based multitenancy is only possible in those systems in which you provide your software as a service \(SaaS\) solution to consumers, i.e. your production and test systems. It is not available in development systems. However, in development systems, in addition to your development tenant, you can create further test tenants within the *Landscape Portal* if required.
