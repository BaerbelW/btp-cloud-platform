# Mapping to MTA Structure

Letâ€™s start by mapping the entities we defined in the previous chapters to the artifacts known to MTAs. The general mapping rule is that applications are MTA modules and service instances are MTA resources. Therefore, the following structure results \(technical names used in the MTA are in brackets\):

-   **MTA Modules**:
    -   Modified Approuter \(approuter\)
-   **MTA Resources**:
    -   XSUAA \(xsuaa\)
    -   SaaS Provisioning \(saas-registry\)
    -   ABAP Solution \(abap-solution\)
