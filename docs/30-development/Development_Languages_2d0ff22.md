# Development Languages

Learn about the development languages supported in the Cloud Foundry environment.

The polylglot nature of SAP BTP means that you have the freedom to choose between various development languages. While we do recommend using Java and Node.js for most use cases, you're free to use the language that best suits your development needs.

Find more information on the three main languages supported by SAP by following the links below:
