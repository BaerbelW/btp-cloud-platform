## Service Consumption Model \(ADT\)

You can create a service client model using the *ADT Creation Wizard*. In your ABAP project, open the context menu and choose*New* \> *Other* \> *ABAP Repository Object* \> *Business Services* \> *Service Consumption Model* to launch the creation wizard.

Proceed as follows:

1.  Enter the following credentials:

    -   Project

    -   Package

    -   Name

    -   Description

    -   Original Language

    -   Generated Service Definition

    -   Service Metadata File

2.  Choose *Next*

3.  Assign a transport request

4.  Choose *Finish*


In the selected package, the ABAP back end system creates a service client model.

In the Project Explorer, the new service client model is added to the *Business Services* folder of the corresponding package node.
