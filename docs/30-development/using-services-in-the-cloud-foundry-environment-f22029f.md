## Service Management

You can also access services for the Cloud Foundry environment through SAP Service Manager, the central registry for service brokers and platforms. Itâ€™s tightly integrated with SAP BTP and allows you to consume services in connected runtime environments and to manage platforms, service brokers, service instances, and service bindings.

-   For more information, see [SAP Service Manager](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/Cloud/en-US/3a27b85a47fc4dff99184dd5bf181e14.html "SAP Service Manager service is the central registry for service brokers and platforms in SAP BTP.") :arrow_upper_right:.
