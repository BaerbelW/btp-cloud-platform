# Updating Service Instances

Use the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface to update service instances:

-   [Update Service Instances Using the SAP BTP Cockpit or Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](Update_Service_Instances_Using_the_SAP_BTP_Cockpit_or_Cloud_Foundry_Command_Line_Interface_54fe2e7.md)


You can also update service instances inside a multitarget application if the service broker supports updates. Change the deployment descriptor file or a configuration file for a service instance inside your multitarget application and deploy your application to trigger an update of the respective service instance.
