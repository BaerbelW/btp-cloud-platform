# ABAP Language

Get an overview of all the objects and services of the ABAP programming language that were released for use in the ABAP environment.

You can use them for basic programming techniques such as data handling and database access. Note that not all objects and services that you know from the ABAP on-premise environment are available \(or available in the same way\).
