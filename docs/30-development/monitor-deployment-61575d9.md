2.  Under *Solution*, click on the *Maintain Solution* tile to open the app.

3.  Select the solution from the list to go to its object page.

4.  Under *Deployment Configurations*, select a deployment configuration to view more details.

5.  5. Scroll to “Deployment History” to see the status of your deployment. Click on an entry to view the logs for this deployment. Click on the icons \(Init, Build, Publish\) to jump to the respective sections of the log.

    If an icon is grey: There is no information available.

    If the icon is red: There is an error. Scan the log to find more information on the error.

    If the icon is blue: The step was completed successfully.
