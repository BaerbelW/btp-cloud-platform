## Delete Tenant

As a consumer subbacount administrator, you can unsubscribe the SaaS solution. However, there is still a grace period of 30 days where the tenant can be restored, until the tenant is irreversibly deleted. See [Consumer Offboarding](consumer-offboarding-c882a2a.md).

Alternatively, as a SaaS solution operator, your can use the *Subscription Management Dashboard* in the provider subaccount to unsubscribe tenants centrally without triggering unsubscription in the consumer subaccount. See [Using the Subscription Management Dashboard](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/434be695f9e946ccb4c28911dd1e16d0.html).

## Restore Deleted Tenant

After unsubscribing from a consumer subaccount, the associated tenant is not immediately deleted, and it can be restored within a given period of time.

As a SaaS solution operator, you can restore the tenant from the Landscape Portal. See [Restore Tenants](restore-tenants-619c40e.md).
