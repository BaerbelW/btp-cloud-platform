## Creating a Knowledge Transfer Document

Using ADT, you can create a knowledge transfer document \(KTD\) for your business configuration maintenance object. This allows you to provide a detailed documentation of the business configuration to the *Maintain Business Configurations* app user. Find out how to create a knowledge transfer document here: [Knowledge Transfer Document](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/latest/en-US/fb51cd65f7f047b7b65b9a08f4e202c0.html). As soon as a KTD object exists for a selected business configuration, the function *Show Documentation* will appear in the header section of your app. If the KTD is not available in the current logon language, the documentation shows the message *Document not found*.

> ### Note:  
> Links in the KTD are not supported.
