# Creating a Job Catalog Entry and a Job Template in ADT

Follow these steps to create a Job Catalog Entry and a Job Template in ADT.



## Procedure

1.  Implement the business logic. You need to create a class which implements certain interfaces so that it is usable in an application job. For more information, see [Implementing the Business Logic](implementing-the-business-logic-99dcde1.md).

2.  Define the Job Catalog Entry. With a method of a certain framework class, you create a Job Catalog Entry which refers to the class of step 1. For more information, see [Creating the Job Catalog Entry](creating-the-job-catalog-entry-1cff59e.md).

3.  Define the Job Template. With another method of the framework class, you create a Job Template which refers to the Job Catalog Entry of step 2. For more information, see [Creating the Job Template](creating-the-job-template-1f04ad2.md).
