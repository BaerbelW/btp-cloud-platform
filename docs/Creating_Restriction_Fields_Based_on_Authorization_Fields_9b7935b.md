# Creating Restriction Fields Based on Authorization Fields

For each authorization field that you want to expose and consider in a business role, you must create a corresponding restriction field and assign it to a restriction type.



## Context

In the example used here, create a restriction field for the bonus variant field.



## Procedure

1.  For the procedure, see the ABAP development user guide: [Defining Restriction Fields](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/be62869bb04e49f6980923b31bbb74d2.html).
