# Setting Up Your Trial Account

Your trial account is set up automatically, so that you can start using it right away. However, if one or more of the automatic steps fail, you can also finalize the setup manually, by following the steps below.

# Create Your Trial Subaccount

The first thing that is needed in the setup of your trial account is the creation of a subaccount. If this step was successful in the SAP BTP cockpit, you can directly skip to the next section.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate into your global account by choosing *Enter Your Trial Account*.

2.  Choose *New Subaccount*.

3.  Configure it as follows:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th>

    Field


    
    </th>
    <th>

    Input


    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Display Name**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    ***trial***


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Description**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    Optional


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Provider**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    Desired infrastructure provider


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Region**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    Desired region


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Subdomain**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    ***<your\_id\>trial***

    Example: **P0123456789trial**


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Enable beta features**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    Optional

    Enables the use of beta services and applications.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    **Custom Properties**


    
    </td>
    <td>

    Optional

    You can use custom properties to identify and organize the subaccounts in your global account. For example, you can filter subaccounts by custom property in some cockpit pages.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    



## Results

You have successfully set up your trial subaccount.

# Create Your Trial Org and Configure Entitlements

Once you have a subaccount \(whether it was created automatically or you followed the steps described above\), you need an org and entitlements.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your subaccount by choosing its tile.

2.  Choose *Enable Cloud Foundry* to create your org.

3.  Once your org is created, choose *Entitlements* from the left hand-side navigation.

4.  Choose *Configure Entitlements* to enter edit mode.

5.  Choose *Add Service Plans* and select all the service plans available for your subaccount.

    > ### Note:  
    > To select a service plan, choose a service from the left and tick all the service plans that appear on the right. Do that for all services.

6.  Once you've added all the service plans, you see them all in a table. Before you choose Save, for all the plans with numerical quota, choose  ÓÅò   to increase the amount to the maximum \(until the icon becomes disabled\).

7.  Finally, choose *Save* to save all your changes and exit edit mode.
