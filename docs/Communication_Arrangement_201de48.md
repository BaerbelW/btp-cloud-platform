# Communication Arrangement

A communication arrangement is a runtime description of a specific communication scenario. It describes which communication partners communicate with each other in the scenario and how they communicate.

To describe this runtime behavior, you have to create an arrangement for a scenario, assign the communication system and communication users, and select the authentication method that shall be used.

An administrator creates the communication arrangement in the SAP Fiori launchpad. Note that it is not transported between systems but created locally. To maintain a communication arrangement, business catalog `SAP_CORE_BC_COM` needs to be assigned to the corresponding user.

Alternatively, a communication arrangement can also be created from a service key.
