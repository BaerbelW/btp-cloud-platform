## Procedure

1.  Select the*Display Connectivity Trace* tile on the SAP Fiori Launchpad to open the app. On the initial screen, click *Define Trace Criteria* in the top-right corner.

2.  Click *Create*.

3.  Enter a description if required. We recommend using a description that is easily identifiable in the filter.

4.  Change the validity if required. The default setting is *10 Minutes*. Unlike a log, a trace is only available for a limited time frame.

5.  Change the *Request Method* if required. The default setting is *All*.

6.  Click *Save*.

## Results

The trace is now activated for the defined criteria. You can filter for it in the *Trace Criterion* dropdown list. Please note that there might be a time delay until the activation takes effect because all the affected components need to be notified.
