# Create Orgs

Once a subaccount is created in the Cloud Foundry environment, you must create an org in order to use it.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your Cloud Foundry subaccount.

2.  In the subaccount *Overview* page, choose *Enable Cloud Foundry*.

3.  Enter a name for your org.

    > ### Note:  
    > Once you've created the org, you can’t change its name afterwards in the SAP BTP cockpit. If you rename the org using the Cloud Foundry CLI \(cf CLI\), the new org name isn't reflected in the cockpit.

4.  If the region you’re working in has multiple landscapes, the *Landscape* option is displayed. Choose the landscape in which to create the org.

5.  Choose *Create*.
