# Analytical Data Modeling

To be able to consume data, the analytical engine needs a multi-dimensional analytical model \(= a star schema\), and a query. Let's take a closer look at the star schema and the query that lies on top of it.

-   **[Star Schema](Star_Schema_483cc06.md "The structure of the analytical model resembles a star (see graphic below):  The cube or
		fact view at its center is surrounded by and connected to various dimension views. That's
		why it is also referred to as a star schema.  ")**  
The structure of the analytical model resembles a star \(see graphic below\): The cube or fact view at its center is surrounded by and connected to various dimension views. That's why it is also referred to as a star schema.
-   **[Query](Query_d3f8dc9.md "")**
