# Maintain Protection Allowlists

With this app you can maintain a list of trusted hosts or URL patterns.



With this app you can define secure applications by adding trusted hosts to allowlists. The following allowlists are available:

-   *Clickjacking Protection*

    By default, clickjacking protection is active to protect your systems against malicious clickjacking. If the system is embedded into another application, the check determines whether the other application is secure. To add trusted hosts, you have to enter specific details, such as schema and port, for each trusted host to make sure that malicious hosts are identified and prevented from calling your system.

-   *Trusted Network Zones*

    Here you can list URL patterns for which a redirect is allowed or blocked.

-   *Trusted CSS Style Sheets*

    Here you can list URL patterns for loading CSS style sheets.
