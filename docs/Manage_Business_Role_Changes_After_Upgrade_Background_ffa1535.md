# Manage Business Role Changes After Upgrade: Background

It is important for you to know how the quarterly release changes impact your productive business roles.

Business role changes often have the technical reason that new developments may require changes to existing applications, business catalogs, restriction types and/or restriction fields. The affected business roles need to be adapted accordingly to ensure that existing apps behave consistently before and after the upgrade.

The following typical changes might occur:

-   Business catalogs were deprecated or split, or have new dependencies so new business catalogs need to be assigned.

-   New apps were added to existing business catalogs.

-   New restriction types were added, removed, or access categories were changed.
