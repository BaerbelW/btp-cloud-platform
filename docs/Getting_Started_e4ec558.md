## Downloading the ABAP Flight Reference Scenario

The ABAP Flight Scenario contains demo content that you can import into your development environment. It contains a data model consisting of database tables filled with travel data such as customer, flights, or airports. The structure of the complete data model allows you to build simple but also more complex services. That way, it's easy to follow the steps in this development guide while building your own queries based on the same database tables as in the given examples.
