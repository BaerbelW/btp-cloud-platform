<a name="loiof5bbc57845ef47bab40d0da3ec754e79__prereq_a4p_d4t_b4b"/>

## Prerequisites

Ð£ou have created the `SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility` service instance in the Cloud Foundry or Kyma environment. See:

-   [Create an SAP S/4HANA Extensibility Service Instance in the Cloud Foundry Environment](Create_an_SAP_S4HANA_Extensibility_Service_Instance_in_the_Cloud_Foundry_Environment_531a909.md)

-   [Create an SAP S/4HANA Extensibility Service Instance in the Kyma Environment](Create_an_SAP_S4HANA_Extensibility_Service_Instance_in_the_Kyma_Environment_55d876e.md)




## Context

After you have created the `SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility` service instance, you need to configure event topics for the channel inside the SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant, and then you need to create an SAP Event Mesh service instance for the application to consume SAP S/4HANA Cloud events.



## Procedure

1.  Configure event topics for the channel inside SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant. Use the channel you have specified in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility service descriptor JSON file when configuring the parameters for the communication arrangement in SAP S4/HANA Cloud tenant.

    To configure the event topics, follow the steps described in [Configure Event Publishing and Event Consumption Scenarios](https://help.sap.com/viewer/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/2108.500/en-US/978b0394caf94e558f488282f68a8bcb.html) in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud documentation.

    As an example, you can use the *sap/s4/beh/businesspartner/v1/BusinessPartner/Changed/v1* outbound topic.

## Next Steps

Create an SAP Event Mesh service instance in the Cloud Foundry or the Kyma environment. See:

-   [Create an SAP Event Mesh Service Instance in the Cloud Foundry Environment](Create_an_SAP_Event_Mesh_Service_Instance_in_the_Cloud_Foundry_Environment_c2d4d87.md)
