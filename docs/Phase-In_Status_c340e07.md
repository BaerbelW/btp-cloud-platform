# Phase-In Status

For authority checks, you can assign the *Phase-In* status to restrictions. This means that the values have no effect in the system at the moment. Therefore, you can prepare your system for new restrictions that will be active in the next release.

The *Phase-Out* status denotes that the restriction will be removed in the next release.
