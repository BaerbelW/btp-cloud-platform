# Gather Support Information

The Eclipse tools come with a wizard for gathering support information in case you need help with a feature or operation \(during deploying/debugging applications, logging, configurations, and so on\).



## Context

The wizard collects the information in a ZIP file, which can be later sent to the support team. This way, the support developers can get better understanding of your environment and process the issue faster.



## Procedure

1.  From the Eclipse IDE, choose *Help* \> *Collect Support Information*.

2.  The launched wizard lists the default components to be collected, depending on the tools youâ€™ve installed. If you need the support team to look at specific resources, expand the *Additional Data* section and select the relevant items.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you select *Screenshot*, your currently open Eclipse windows and views are snapped as a picture and added to the ZIP file. Make sure you don't reveal sensitive information.

3.  In the *File Name* field, specify the ZIP file name and location.

4.  Choose *Finish*.




## Next Steps

You can create a support ticket, attach the files to it, and send it to the corresponding support team. For more information, see [Getting Support](Getting_Support_5dd7398.md).
