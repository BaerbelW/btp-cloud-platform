# Sizing

After you have prepared measurements for sizing and a tester has executed the relevant test cases, you can now perform system sizing for each relevant business process.

With the help of the *Perform System Sizing* app, you can get sizing results for individual test cases in ABAP compute units. If you combine your results for all business processes, you can get a sizing for the overall business scenario.
