# Commands in the btp CLI

A list of all tasks and respective commands that are available in the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\).

> ### Tip:  
> After login, all commands are executed in the global account. If you want to work in a specific subaccount or a directory, we recommend to set the default context by using `btp target` \(see [Set the Default Command Context](set-the-default-command-context-720645a.md)\). Once you have done so, you do not have to pass the subaccount or directory parameter with every command.

> ### Tip:  
> You can find extensive help about each command directly in the btp CLI. For example, use one of the following commands for help on `btp list accounts/subaccount`:
> 
> ```
> `btp help list accounts/subaccount`
> ```
> 
> ```
> `btp --help list accounts/subaccount`
> ```
> 
> ```
> `btp list accounts/subaccount --help`
> ```
