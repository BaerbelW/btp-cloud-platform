# Log on with a Browser to the Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication service

Platform users of the Cloud Foundry environment have the option to log on with a custom identity provider or the default identity provider.

## Prerequisites

-   Your multi-environment subaccount has been configured with a custom identity provider for platform users.

    Without this configuration, you must always log on with the default identity provider, which is SAP ID service.

    To log on with a custom identity provider, you must know the origin key of the identity provider.

    For more information, see [Establish Trust and Federation of Custom Identity Providers for Platform Users in Multi-Environment Subaccounts \[Feature Set A\]](establish-trust-and-federation-of-custom-identity-providers-8600afb-md).

-   You don't already have a session with the Cloud Foundry environment.

    If you're already authentication, you skip the logon process and go straight to your application.




## Context

When you're accessing a web application like a service dashboard \(for example `logs.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`\) or you log into your Cloud Foundry account using the CLI with `cf login -sso`, youâ€™re prompted by a login screen.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the URL for your service dashboard or provided by the CF CLI.

    The login screen appears.
