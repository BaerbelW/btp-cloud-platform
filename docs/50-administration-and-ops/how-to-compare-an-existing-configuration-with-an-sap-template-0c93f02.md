# How to Compare an Existing Configuration With an SAP Template

You can compare an existing configuration that has been created based on an SAP template with the current SAP template to see if there are any deviations.



## Context

Because SAP templates are updated from time to time, it can be useful to compare existing configurations that are based on an SAP template. To check for templates with deviations and to see what has changed, follow these steps:



## Procedure

1.  Under *Administration* open *Configuration*.

2.  Choose the channel that you want to search through.

3.  Under *Search Criteria* select **Deviations from SAP Template** is **True**.

4.  Choose *Search*.

5.  Choose one of the search results.

6.  Choose *More* and select :balance_scale:.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you want to rebuild a configuration based on an updated version of the SAP Template, close the pop-up window, choose the configuration, then choose *More* and select :arrows_clockwise:.
