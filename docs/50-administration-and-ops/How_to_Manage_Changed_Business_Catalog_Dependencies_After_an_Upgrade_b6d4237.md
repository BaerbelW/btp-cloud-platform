1.  Select the *Manage Business Role Changes After Upgrade* tile on the SAP Fiori Launchpad to open the app. On the initial screen, view the*Business Catalog Dependencies* area to get an overview of what has changed with the last upgrade. Filter for certain change types if required, for example if you only want to see the removed or the added dependencies.

2.  Download a csv file containing all recently changed business catalog dependencies if required.

3.  Click on the required business catalog dependency to check how the changed dependency affects your business roles. The business roles affected by the changes to this dependency are displayed in a list. By clicking on the business catalog *Name* above the list, you can view a description of the business catalog and its newly added dependencies or recently removed dependencies after an upgrade.

4.  To find more information about the affected business roles or to make further changes, you can cross-navigate to the *Maintain Business Roles* app by clicking on the link listed in the *Business Role ID* column.
