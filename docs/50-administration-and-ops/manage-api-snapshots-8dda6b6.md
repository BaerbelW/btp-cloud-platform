# Manage API Snapshots



With this app you can create API snapshots of your components. An API snapshot is a snapshot of the external interface of all released objects within a software component. This snapshot should be taken when the released objects within the software component must be kept stable. API snapshots allow you to run compatibility checks for your released objects using the ATC check`API_COMPATIBILITY`.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Create API snapshots to be able to use them in compatibility checks

-   Regenerate failed APIs

-   Set APIs for check relevance to check their content

-   Overwrite your API snapshots to recreate already existing snapshots

-   Display the changes made to your API snapshots

-   Display extracted APIs
