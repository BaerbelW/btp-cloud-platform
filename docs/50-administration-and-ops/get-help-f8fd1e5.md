# Get Help

There is extensive help in the btp CLI about every command. You can get help with the `help` action or the `--help` option.

There are several ways to call help in the btp CLI, and there is help on all levels, from a basic entry page thats explains the syntax to very detailed command-specific help that explains the usage of a command and its parameters in detail.

The easiest way to get help is probably the `help` action \(for basic help, use `btp help`, as shown in the examples below. But you can also place `--help` at the end or beginning of a command call, for example, `btp list help`, `btp --help list`, and `btp list --help` are interchangeable.

Here's the help syntax:

-   `btp help`

-   `btp help <ACTION>`

-   `btp help <GROUP>`

-   `btp help <GROUP>/<OBJECT>`
