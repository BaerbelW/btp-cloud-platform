# How to Clone Software Components



<a name="loio18564c54f529496ba420d4c83545a2ce__section_q4w_4fj_1mb"/>

## Context

If a software component is not locally in your system yet, you will first need to clone it once to import it into your system.

> ### Note:  
> Cloning a software component is only necessary once per system instance.

## Procedure

1.  Go to the details page of the software component you would like to clone.

2.  Click *Clone*.

3.  A pop-up opens. You can now select which branch you would like to import. If the software component does not have branches yet, the master or main branch \(dependent on when the repository was created\) is automatically selected. Confirm by clicking *Clone*.

4.  The software component with the selected branch is now imported into your current system instance. The *Clone* button turns into a *Pull* button. From now on, you can use it to pull \(remotely available\) changes of your software component to your system.


> ### Note:  
> It is recommended to clone multiple software components one by one. Please clone software components with objects that are reused by other components first.
