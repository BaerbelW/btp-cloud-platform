## Administration of Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts

Some of the typical responsibilities of SAP BTP administrators include maintenance of global accounts, management of directories and subaccounts, and configuration of entitlements. To do this, you can use either the SAP BTP cockpit, the SAP BTP command line interface, or APIs.

Environments constitute the actual platform-as-a-service offering of SAP BTP that allows for the development and administration of business applications. Each environment offers different approaches to manage administration and operations. For more information, see [Environments](../10-concepts/Environments_15547f7.md).



### Administration and Operations in the Cloud Foundry Environment
