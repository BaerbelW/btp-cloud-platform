# Maintain Business Roles

You can use this app to create and edit business roles, add business catalogs to the roles, and maintain access restrictions.



With the *Maintain Business Roles* app you define business roles by combining predefined business catalogs and, if necessary, define value help, read and write access by maintaining the allowed values for fields. You use business roles to control the access to your applications. The predefined catalogs contain the actual authorizations that allow users to access apps and allow to define instance-based restrictions where necessary. Business catalogs bundle authorizations for a specific business area. Once you have created a business role, you can assign it to multiple business users who perform similar business tasks.
