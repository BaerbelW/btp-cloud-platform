# Maintain Translations

The *Maintain Translations* app provides an easy way to translate developer extensions into other languages.



<a name="loioe2ca05c69dc94b98bf725396a0b13ace__purpose"/>

## Context

Youâ€™ve built a developer extension and would now like to translate it into other languages. The *Maintain Translations* app allows you to select your text sources and generate an XLIFF \(1.2\) file containing the translatable texts as well as useful notes on them. XLIFF \(XML Localization Interchange File Format\) is a standard used in localization. The XLIFF file can then be forwarded to a dedicated translator or translation agency. Once the XLIFF file has been translated, you can use the *Maintain Translations* app to upload it and publish the translated texts into your system.

-   publish the translated texts to the system.
