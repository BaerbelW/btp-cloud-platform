## Procedure

1.  Open the *Maintain Job Users* app.

2.  Select the scheduled jobs that you want to work with, and choose one of the following actions:

    -   *Change Job Owner and User* to change the owner and the user of your application job

    -   *Delete* to delete your application job


    When clicking on an application job, you'll be navigated to the *Details* page of the *Application Jobs* app.

3.  If you've decided to change the owner and user of your application job, a dialog opens. Enter the new job owner and user by selecting them from the value help. Mind that you can only select owners and users that have the appropriate authorizations. You can choose to only display these users by filtering for *Only Valid*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If a job owner is a communication user, the owner can't be changed, since the connection to the corresponding communication arrangement of the type `SAP_COM_0064` would be broken.

4.  You can change multiple application job owners and users at the same time. To do this, select all users you want to change and choose *Change Job Owner and User*.
5.  You can choose to display the change history of your application job by selecting *Change History*. All changes that were made to the owner and user in the past are shown in the change history. The change history shows the user type, and the new and old user IDs. You can view who changed the user, and when it was changed. The type of change is shown, too.

6.  You can delete multiple application jobs at the same time. To do this, select all jobs you want to delete and choose *Delete*.


You've now maintained your job user.
