# Communication Arrangements

A communication arrangement is required for the event exchange between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.



To use a communication arrangement, you need to create a service instance for the SAP Event Mesh. The service instance contains all information required to establish a connection. This required information, such as endpoints and credentials, are stored in the service key. The enterprise event enablement extracts the information of the service key and creates the corresponding destination and OAuth 2.0 client configuration automatically.
