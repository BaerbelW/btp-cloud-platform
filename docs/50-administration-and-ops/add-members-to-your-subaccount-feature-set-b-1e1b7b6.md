# Add Members to Your Subaccount \[Feature Set B\]

Add members to your subaccount to enable users to access resources available there. Platform users manage subaccounts with cloud management tools, while business users consume subscribed applications and services.

## Prerequisites

-   You must be a subaccount administrator to add other subaccount members.

-   Youâ€™re managing a multi-environment subaccount.

    For more information about adding members to Neo subaccounts, see [Add Members to Your Subaccount \[Feature Set B\]](add-members-to-your-subaccount-feature-set-b-1e1b7b6.md).

-   The users exist in a trusted identity provider.

    All users of SAP BTP are stored in identity providers, either in the default or in a custom identity provider. SAP BTP needs a copy of the user, sometimes called a shadow user. You assign the shadow user authorizations to access resources in SAP BTP. When a user authenticates, SAP BTP forwards the request to the identity provider.

    For more information, see [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](trust-and-federation-with-identity-providers-cb1bc8f.md).

## Context

> ### Note:  
> The content in this section is only relevant for cloud management tools feature set B. For more information, see [Cloud Management Tools - Feature Set Overview](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/caf4e4e23aef4666ad8f125af393dfb2.html).

There are two types of users in subaccounts:

-   Platform users

    These users are members of your team. Platform users manage the subaccount with the SAP BTP cockpit or perform development or operations tasks in the Cloud Foundry environment.

    Assign users who need to manage or view the subaccount in SAP BTP cockpit one of the following predefined role collections:

    -   *Subaccount Administrator*

    -   *Subaccount Viewer*


    For more information about these role collections, see [Role Collections and Roles in Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts \[Feature Set B\]](../10-concepts/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts-feature-set-b-0039cf0.md).

-   Business users

    These users consume applications and services to which the subaccount is subscribed. Business users don't access cloud management tools like the SAP BTP cockpit. Assign role collections required by the applications and services the business users consume.
