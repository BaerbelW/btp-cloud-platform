# Troubleshooting and Support

Troubleshooting and support information for the btp CLI.

## Make sure that you are using a recent version of the btp CLI client

We recommend checking for updates of the client on a regular basis. Most new functionality is added via the CLI server, so no update from your side is required. But if new functionality is added to the client, the only way to get it is by downloading and installing a newer version.

Run the command `btp` or `btp --info` to find out which version of the client you are using. Then check on our [download page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud-cpcli) for the current version and install the latest client.

Use `btp --help` to display an overview of all commands. If new commands are available but cannot be used with your client version, these commands are marked with a notice to update your client. If you run such a command, you get an error message pointing you to the client version that you need.

## I cannot log on

To log on, run `btp login`. During interactive logon, confirm the server URL that is proposed by the CLI and provide the subdomain of your global account. The btp CLI is part of our cloud management tools feature set B. This means that you can only access a global account that uses this feature set B. For example, all trial accounts are on feature set B. For more information, see [Cloud Management Tools â€” Feature Set Overview](../10-concepts/cloud-management-tools-feature-set-overview-caf4e4e.md).

## I'd like to setup a global account with the command line

If you don't know how to get started, you might want to have a look at the appropriate workflow: [Setting Up a Trial Account via the Command Line \[Feature Set B\]](../20-getting-started/setting-up-a-trial-account-via-the-command-line-feature-set-b-a21360f.md) or [Setting Up a Global Account via the Command Line \[Feature Set B\]](../20-getting-started/setting-up-a-global-account-via-the-command-line-feature-set-b-accd5b2.md).

## I'd like to see a more detailed output \(verbose mode\)

If you get an error message that is not helpful enough, or if you want to find out more about what exactly happened after you ran a command, use the `btp --verbose` option with your command and run it again. The btp CLI will try to execute the command again, but also print information about each step of the command execution. This might help you understand what exactly went wrong and provide hints for you to solve the issue. If you need to create a support request, providing this information helps us analyze the error and provide a solution more quickly.

Here is an example of the `btp list security/role-collection` command call without the option:

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> btp list security/role-collection
> name                         	description
> Global Account Administrator 	Administrative access to the global account
> Global Account Viewer        	Read-only access to the global account
> 
> OK
> 
> ```

If you use `btp --verbose list security/role-collection`, the output is much more lengthy. It contains information such as client version and the current context, the correlation ID, and request and response details.

## I need support

Use component `BC-CP-TOOLS-CLI` to contact support.

If a correlation ID is printed with your error message, please provide it with your support ticket. The correlation ID is created for each command execution, and is passed with all of its steps. It allows the identification of all log messages related to a command execution.

See [Getting Support](../70-getting-support/getting-support-5dd7398.md).
