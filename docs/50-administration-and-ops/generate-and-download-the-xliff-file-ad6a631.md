## Procedure

1.  In the *Maintain Customizing Translations* app, open the project you want to have translated and scroll down to *Translations*.

2.  Select the entry for the source and target language for which you want to generate the XLIFF file.

3.  Navigate to *Download*. Here you can select whether the XLIFF file should contain all texts \(*All Texts*\) or only those texts that were changed since you last published a translated XLIFF file in these languages \(*Changed Texts*\). If this is the first time you are generating an XLIFF file for the project for the given source and target language, choose *All Texts*.

    The XLIFF file will now be downloaded to your computer. You can send it to your dedicated translator or translation agency to be translated.
