## Prerequisites

To be able to view and use the apps in the SAP Fiori launchpad, you need a business role with specific business catalogs. You can either use the business roles that are available with the ABAP environment or you can create business roles that include the relevant business catalogs. For more information about the business catalogs and business roles, see [Business Catalogs and Business Roles](business-catalogs-and-business-roles-da32065.md). For more information about creating business roles from available business role templates in the ABAP environment, see also [How to Create a Business Role from a Template](how-to-create-a-business-role-from-a-template-ec310a8.md).
