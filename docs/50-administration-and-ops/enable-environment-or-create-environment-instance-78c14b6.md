## Prerequisites

-   You’re managing a multi-environment subaccount.

-   You’re a subaccount administrator.

-   You have free quota assigned to your subaccount.




## Context

On a subaccount level, environments constitute the actual platform-as-a-service \(PaaS\) offering of SAP BTP that allows for the development and administration of business applications.

Each environment comes equipped with specific tools, technologies, and runtimes that you need to build applications. The availability of different environments allows for greater flexibility in your development process.

For more information, see [Environments](../10-concepts/environments-15547f7.md).



## Procedure

1.  Navigate into the subaccount.

2.  Choose your method: **Enable Environment** or **Create an Environment Instance**.

    -   **Enable Environment**: On the *Subaccount - Overview* page, click *Enable <Environment\>*.
    -   **Create an Environment Instance**: See [Environment Instances](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/Cloud/en-US/1d6897d22f90443c8a3f9f6c8bb41bb8.html).
