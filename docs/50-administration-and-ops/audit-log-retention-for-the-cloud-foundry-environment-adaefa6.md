# Audit Log Retention for the Cloud Foundry Environment

The audit log data stored for your account is retained for 90 days, after which it's deleted.

In case you want to retain and use the data for more than 90 days, you can retrieve it via the [Audit Log Retrieval API Usage for the Cloud Foundry Environment](audit-log-retrieval-api-usage-for-the-cloud-foundry-environment-30ece35.md) and store it in another persistent storage.
