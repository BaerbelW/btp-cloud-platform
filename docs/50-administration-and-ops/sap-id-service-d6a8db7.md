## Managing Users

To add users to a subaccount, they must exist in an identity provider. For more information about adding users to SAP ID service, see [Create SAP User Accounts](create-sap-user-accounts-ebe42f6.md).

To add new users to a subscribed app, or to add users to a service, such as Web IDE, add those users to your subaccount. See [Add Users from SAP ID Service for Multi-Environment Subaccounts](add-users-from-sap-id-service-for-multi-environment-subaccounts-760ab77.md)

## Multifactor Authentication

As a self-service, users can enable multifactor authentication for SAP ID service.

For more information, see [How to Enable Multi-Factor Authentication \(MFA\)](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/mfa.html) on the *SAP Support Portal*.

## Trust and Identity Providers

Trust between your subaccount and SAP ID service is preconfigured by default, so you can start using it without further configuration.

In cloud management tools feature set A, you can set the default trust to inactive, for example if you prefer to use another identity provider.

In cloud management tools feature set B, you can hide the default trust. For more information, see [Hide Logon Link for Default Identity Provider](hide-logon-link-for-default-identity-provider-9e3d457.md).

To use a custom identity provider, you must establish trust to your custom identity provider. We describe a custom trust configuration using the example of SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication.

For more information, see [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](trust-and-federation-with-identity-providers-cb1bc8f.md).
