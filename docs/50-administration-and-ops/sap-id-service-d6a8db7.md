# SAP ID Service

The default platform identity provider and application identity provider of SAP BTP is SAP ID service.



## Context

Trust to SAP ID service in your subaccount is pre-configured in both the Neo and the Cloud Foundry environment of SAP BTP by default, so you can start using it without further configuration. Optionally, you can add additional trust settings. Using the SAP BTP cockpit, you can make changes by navigating to your respective subaccount and by choosing *Security* \> *Trust Configuration* for multi-environment subaccounts, and *Security* \> *Authorization* for Neo.

In cloud management tools feature set A, you can set the default trust to inactive, for example if you prefer to use another identity provider.

In cloud management tools feature set B, you can hide the default trust. For more information, see [Hide Logon Link for Default Identity Provider](hide-logon-link-for-default-identity-provider-9e3d457.md).

If you want to add new users to a subscribed app, or if you want to add users to a service, such as Web IDE, you can add those users to SAP ID service in your subaccount. See [Add Users from SAP ID Service for Multi-Environment Subaccounts](add-users-from-sap-id-service-for-multi-environment-subaccounts-760ab77.md)

> ### Note:  
> If you want to use a custom IdP, you must establish trust to your custom identity provider. We describe a custom trust configuration using the example of SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication.
> 
> For more information, see [Trust and Federation with Identity Providers](trust-and-federation-with-identity-providers-cb1bc8f.md).
