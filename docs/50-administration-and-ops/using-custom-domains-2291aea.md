# Using Custom Domains

SAP BTP allows subaccount owners to make their SAP BTP applications reachable and secure via a custom domain that is different from the default domain â€“ for example, **subdomain.mydomain.com**.

See the documentation for the [Custom Domain service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CUSTOM_DOMAINS/Cloud/en-US) for more information about configuring and managing custom domains.
