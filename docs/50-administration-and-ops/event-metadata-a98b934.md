## Event Metadata

Enterprise Event Enablement is applying the Cloud Events standard \([https://cloudevents.io/](https://cloudevents.io/)\) for the runtime representation of an event. CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats to ensure interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

You can find all released SAP events on the *SAP API Business Hub*. The *SAP API Business Hub*is the central catalogue of SAP and selected partner APIs to search, discover, test and consume these APIs to build extensions or integrations using SAP Business Technology Platform.

Enterprise Event Enablement applies the `Async API standard` to describe a catalogue of events...

> ### Note:  
> You can find the corresponding `Async API` event catalogues for released events in the *Event Ressources* section of the individual released events on the *SAP API Business Hub*. This specification is required for example to create an *Event Consumption Model*. For more information, see [Event Consumption Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/25cf71e63940453397a32dc2b7676947/ea3dbc187ccd4c16aa9d0a11af1efd47.html).

On the *Event Metadata* tab, you can view the metadata for the event types selected on the *Outbound Event Topic Bindings* tab for Event Publishing. This metadata contains the definition of the structure of all event types which you have selected for publishing from the ABAP environment system. The metadata is represented in as AsyncAPI catalog of events and can contain released SAP as well as customer events.
