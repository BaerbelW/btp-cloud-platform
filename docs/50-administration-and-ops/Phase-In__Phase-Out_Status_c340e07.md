# Phase-In / Phase-Out Status

If a restriction is in status *Phase-In*, the values have no effect in the system at the moment. Therefore, you can prepare your system for new restrictions that will be active in the next release.

The *Phase-Out* status denotes that the restriction will be removed in the next release.
