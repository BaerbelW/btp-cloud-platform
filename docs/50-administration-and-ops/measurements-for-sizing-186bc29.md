# Measurements for Sizing

After you've defined test cases for sizing-relevant business processes, you can now measure the workload that each business process generates.

> ### Note:  
> This section of the documentation describes the steps necessary to prepare and execute a single test case for a business process. To obtain a combined sizing of all relevant business processes \(see [Defining the Sizing-Relevant Business Processes](defining-the-sizing-relevant-business-processes-4c482a9.md)\), perform the steps described in this section for each business process individually and add up the results.
