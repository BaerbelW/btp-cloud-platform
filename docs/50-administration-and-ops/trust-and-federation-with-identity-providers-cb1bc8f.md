# Trust and Federation with Identity Providers

When setting up accounts you need to assign users. While we provide you with your first users to get you started, your organization has identity providers that you want to integrate.

SAP BTP supports identity federation, a concept of linking and reusing digital identities of a user base across loosely coupled systems. Identity federation frees applications on SAP BTP from the need to obtain and store the credentials of users and to authenticate them. Instead, the application user base is reused from identity providers, which support the administration of digital user identities, authentication, and authorizations in a centralized and decoupled manner. To enable communication between SAP BTP and identity providers, you must cross-configure the communication endpoints of the involved systems, establishing a trust relationship between them.

> ### Recommendation:  
> We recommend that you use SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication as a proxy, especially if your business users are stored in multiple corporate identity providers.
> 
> For this scenario, connect Identity Authentication as single custom identity provider to SAP BTP. Next use Identity Authentication to integrate your corporate identity providers.

Identity Provider and XSUAA in SAP BTP Architecture

 ![](images/CF_Trust_for_Identity_Providers_3663b18.png "Identity Provider and XSUAA in SAP BTP Architecture") 

Identity Authentication is a multitenancy enabled identity management service for all applications powered by SAP BTP and optionally on-premise applications. The service provides capabilities for authentication, single sign-on, user provisioning, and on-premise integration as well as self-services like self-registration or password reset â€” for both the employees and the partners and customers of your organization. For administrators, the service offers features for user lifecycle management and reporting capabilities in the administration console.

SAP BTP has its own Identity Authentication tenant, SAP ID service. SAP ID service is the default identity provider of SAP BTP and where you register to get initial access to SAP BTP. Trust to SAP ID service is preconfigured by default.

We recommend that you request your own Identity Authentication tenant, but you can also use any other identity provider, which supports the SAML 2.0 protocol. To establish trust with your identity provider, perform one of the following procedures.
