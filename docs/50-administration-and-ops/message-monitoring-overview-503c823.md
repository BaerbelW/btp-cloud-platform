# Message Monitoring Overview



With this app, you can see an overview of all the interfaces that you're responsible for monitoring. The intuitive card-based view provides a holistic overview of your message interfaces and also provides additional details like the number of messages in different statuses for each interface. When you click on the specific status for a specific interface, you're redirected to *Message Monitoring*. Here, you can see a filtered view of the messages in the status that you selected for the specific interface containing the log information and key field information. For example, in the *Message Monitoring Overview* app, if you're monitoring an interface *AIF\_XXX\_MMO* and in the card specific to *AIF\_XXX\_MMO*, you click on the status *Error*, you're redirected to the *Message Monitoring* where you can see all the messages in status *Error* for the interface *AIF\_XXX\_MMO*. You also see the log information and key field information for the messages in the *Error* status. This improves the efficiency of you finding the list of messages in a specific status for a given interface.

> ### Tip:  
> If you don't see the interface you're assigned to, verify that your user is assigned to the corresponding recipient using the *Assign Recipients to Users* app.
