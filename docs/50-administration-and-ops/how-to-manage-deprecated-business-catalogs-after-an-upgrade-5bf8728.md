## Procedure

1.  Select the *Manage Business Role Changes After Upgrade* tile on the SAP Fiori Launchpad to open the app. On the initial screen, view the*Deprecated Business Catalogs* area to get an overview of what has changed with the last upgrade.

2.  Download a csv file containing all recently deprecated business catalogs if required.

3.  Click on the required business catalog to check how the deprecation affects your business roles. The business roles affected by the deprecated business catalog are displayed in a list. By clicking on the business catalog *Name* above the list, you can view a description of the deprecated business catalog and the successor business catalog.

4.  Select the required business role and click *Adopt Changes* if you want to take over the changes to your business roles. Please note that you might lose your maintained restrictions by doing this. We recommend that you validate the business role after the automatic adoption. By adopting the changes, you add all the successors business catalogs to the selected roles. The deprecated catalog will be removed.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the deprecated business catalogs contain extensions and you click *Adopt Changes*, the included extensions will be removed. If you want to keep these extensions, you need to re-assign them.

5.  Select the *Add the dependent business catalogs of the successor business catalogs* checkbox if required.

6.  Click *OK*. The system displays a progress bar and a list of change results when it is done.

7.  Click *Close* to return to the *Deprecated Business Catalogs*area.
