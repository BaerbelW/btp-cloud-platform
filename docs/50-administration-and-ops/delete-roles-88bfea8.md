# Delete Roles

Use the SAP BTP cockpit to delete a role. If this role has been added to a role collection, it's also deleted from the role collection.

## Context

You can use existing role templates to create new roles. An SAP BTP cockpit wizard helps you to configure new roles.

> ### Note:  
> You cannot delete roles that belong to default role collections delivered by SAP BTP.

## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account and subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\).

3.  If your role comes with a subscribed application, continue as described in [Configure Application Roles and Assign Roles to Users](configure-application-roles-and-assign-roles-to-users-56a7153.md).

4.  Choose *Security* in the navigation pane.

5.  Choose *Roles*.

    Here you see a complete list of all existing roles sorted by application name. It also contains the role template, role names, and role description. On the right side, you find the action buttons.

6.  Choose the :wastebasket: \(Delete\) action button in the row of the role that you want to delete. If the role has been added to a role collection, it's also deleted from the role collection.

7.  Confirm that you want to delete the role.
