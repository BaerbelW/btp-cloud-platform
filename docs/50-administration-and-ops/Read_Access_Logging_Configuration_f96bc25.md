# Read Access Logging Configuration



With this app you can configure Read Access Logging to determine which read access to data is logged and under which conditions.



> ### Restriction:  
> RAL items can not be created in the P system, only in the Q system. If you try to create configurations, log domains, purposes or recordings in the P system, you will get an error message saying ***Items of type SRAL\_<RAL Item\> must not be edited in this system***. You can still activate and deactivate RAL items in the P system.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Define purposes of Read Access Logging
-   Define semantic grouping of fields to be logged
-   Manage recordings of application user interfaces
-   Change predelivered configurations of what to log
-   Enable Read Access Logging in current client
-   Check runtime errors and see changes to configurations
