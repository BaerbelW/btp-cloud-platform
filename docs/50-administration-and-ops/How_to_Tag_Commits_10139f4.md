# How to Tag Commits

You can assign a tag name and tag description to individual commits.

1.  In the *Manage Software Components* app, open your software component.
2.  Navigate to a branch. Commits on this branch are displayed in the *List of Commits*.
3.  Select a commit and click *Add Tag* to add a tag name and a tag description.
4.  **\(Optional\)** Navigate to the *Tagging* tab of your software component to see a table listing all the tags on the branch that is currently checked out/active. Log entries for the creation and deletion of tags are also displayed in the*Recent Actions* table in the *History* tab.

> ### Note:  
> Note that there can only be a 1-to-1 relationship between a commit and a tag, i.e., a commit can only ever have a maximum of 1 tag.
