# Create the Kyma Environment Instance from Service Marketplace

Enable the Kyma environment from Service Marketplace.



## Context

To enable the Kyma environment on your subaccount, you must create an instance of it. You can do this either by selecting *Enable Kyma* from the subaccount overview or creating it from Service Marketplace, following the same wizard steps as for SAP services and applications. The second option allows you to configure the instance by selecting the region in which you want to create the cluster and the number of virtual machines to run on it.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your subaccount.

2.  Go to *Services* \> *Service Marketplace* and select *Kyma Environment*.

3.  Select *Create* either from actions in the upper-right corner of the tile or from the tile overview page to which you get by clicking on the tile.

4.  Change *Instance Name* or leave the default one. You see the default *Plan* assigned to your account. Choose *Next* to move to the plan configuration view.

    > ### Note:  
    > The default plan and its specification can differ depending on your global account type. For details, see [Available Plans](Available_Plans_befe01d.md).

5.  Once in the *Parameters* view, specify the name of your cluster. You can also configure your instance parameters by changing its region and the maximum or the minimum number of virtual machines to be created for it. Confirm changes by selecting *Create*.
