> ### Caution:  
> The management of data in an extension scenario deviates from the management of data in the standard scenarios. You are responsible for ensuring that the data used in an extension scenario is managed in accordance with any applicable legal requirements or business needs, such as data protection legislation or data life cycle requirements. The extensibility framework should not be used for the processing of personal data if this processing falls under any applicable data protection legislation.
