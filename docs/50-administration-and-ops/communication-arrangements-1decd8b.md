# Communication Arrangements

With this app you can create and edit communication arrangements that your company has set up with a communication partner. The system provides communication scenarios for inbound and outbound communication that you can use to create communication arrangements. Inbound communication defines how business documents are received from a communication partner, whereas outbound communication defines how business documents are sent to a communication partner. The communication scenario determines the authorizations, inbound and outbound services and the supported authentications methods, that are required for the communication.
