# Automatic Reprocessing Extension



With this app you can configure the automatic reprocessing that is executed when a specific message fails.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Create, edit, and delete automatic reprocessing settings for a specific combination of log message and interface. Whenever the selected log message fails, the configuration you defined is executed.

-   Define a maximum number of reprocessing attempts that can be executed for a failed log message.

-   Define a minimum waiting time that must pass before the application can trigger a reprocessing attempt. The waiting time can take longer depending on the interval of the background job that executes the reprocessing.

-   Define the intermediate status \(In Process or Error\) the failed log message displays while it's waiting to be reprocessed.
