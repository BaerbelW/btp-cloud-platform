## Procedure

1.  In the *Maintain Customizing Translations* app, open the project for which you want to create a translation from a source language to a target language. You can choose to select either a single language or more than one language.
2.  Scroll down to *Translations* and click *Create*.
3.  Select a *Source Language* and *Target Language* from the dropdown menus and confirm with *Create*.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can select from all of the languages that are installed in the system. For a given text source, it's only possible to maintain translations for languages other than the original language.
    > 
    > Note that deleting a previously created translation entry for a given source and target language pair will only delete the corresponding entry in the translation project. Already published texts for the target language of the translation will not be deleted from the system.

4.  A new entry has now been added to the list.

5.  Repeat these steps for all source and target languages.
