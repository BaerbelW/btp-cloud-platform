# Business Catalogs

You use this app to display all available business catalogs.



With this app you can get an overview of the business catalogs, their status \(for example *Deprecated*\), and their usage within business roles. You use this application to see which applications and business catalogs delivered by SAP have changed, for example after an upgrade. They may also be deprecated. As a key user, you need to have an overview of these changes to adapt the affected business roles accordingly.
