# Create a Translation Project



## Context

You want to translate your developer extension. Before you can select your text sources and target languages, you need to create a translation project.

> ### Note:  
> Please assign the business catalog `SAP_A4C_BC_TRN_MNG_PC` to ensure that changes can be recorded on transport requests.



## Procedure

1.  Open the *Maintain Translations* app.

2.  Click *+* \(Create\) to create a new translation project.

3.  Fill in an identifier for your project, a name and description, and the name of the package that should contain your translation project.

4.  Click *Create* at the bottom right of your screen.

5.  You now need to add your translation project to a transport. You can either use an existing transport request that matches the transport target of the package you have selected for the translation project, or create a new one by clicking *Create*. Save your changes by clicking *Select*.
