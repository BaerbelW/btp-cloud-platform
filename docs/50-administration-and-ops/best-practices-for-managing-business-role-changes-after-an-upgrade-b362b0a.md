# Best Practices for Managing Business Role Changes After an Upgrade

We recommend downloading a list of all the changes that have taken place after an upgrade before you adjust your business roles using the *Manage Business Roles After an Upgrade* app. You can do this by clicking *Download* \(csv format is supported\). This helps you to keep an overview of what has changed. Once you have modified your business roles, the respective changed objects disappear from the list in the app. It is therefore advisable to keep a separate worklist on your local machine.

We also recommend adjusting your business roles using the *Manage Business Roles After an Upgrade* app only if one change applies to one business role. If there is more than one change, we recommend making the required changes manually in the *Maintain Business Roles* app.

**Restriction Types / Business Catalog Dependencies**

An affected business role is no longer shown in the list once the business role has been saved the first time after the upgrade/update.

The change itself will no longer be visible in the app after all listed affected business roles have been saved the first time after the upgrade/update.

**Deprecated Business Catalogs / Business Role Template**

An affected business role is no longer shown in the list once the respective change has been incorporated in the business role.

The change itself will no longer be visible in the app after the respective change has been incorporated in all affected business roles.
