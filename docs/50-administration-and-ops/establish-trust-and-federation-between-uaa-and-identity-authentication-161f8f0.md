# Establish Trust and Federation Between UAA and Identity Authentication

Use your SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication tenant as an identity provider or a proxy to your own identity provider hosting your business users. This method avoids the upload and download of SAML meta data by using Open ID Connect \(OIDC\) to establish trust.

> ### Note:  
> The content in this topic is relevant for cloud management tools feature set A and cloud management tools feature set B.

> ### Note:  
> The content in this section is not relevant for China \(Shanghai\) and Government Cloud \(US\) regions.

> ### Restriction:  
> You can only establish trust with a single tenant of Identity Authentication per subaccount using this method.
> 
> You canâ€™t choose an Identity Authentication tenant with a custom domain.

> ### Recommendation:  
> We recommend that you always use SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication as single identity provider for SAP BTP. If you use corporate identity providers, connect them to your Identity Authentication tenant, which then acts as a hub. We especially recommend this if you are using multiple corporate identity providers. For platform users, the use of SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication is mandatory.

## Results

You've configured trust in your tenant of the Identity Authentication service, which is your identity provider. Identity Authentication creates an application with the prefix *XSUAA\_* and the display name of your subaccount in the administration console for Identity Authentication.

> ### Example:  
> If your subaccount was named *My Subaccount*, the resulting application in Identity Authentication would be *XSUAA\_My Subaccount*.

> ### Tip:  
> To troubleshoot problems with tokens from Identity Authentication, see [Logging OpenID Connect Tokens](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/b6c42b53518b46de8b4dffd8c4c52ed7.html?version=Cloud) in the documentation for Identity Authentication.
