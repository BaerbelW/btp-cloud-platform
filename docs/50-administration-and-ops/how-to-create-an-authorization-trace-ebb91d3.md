## Results

Once the authorization trace is active, the user will have to execute the apps that s/he does not have authorization for. S/he needs to log on and navigate to the apps in question.

If any authorization checks are executed, they are listed in the log table.

When your checks have been finished, the trace would need to be deactivated, which can be done by pressing the *Deactivate Trace* button in the top-right corner.
