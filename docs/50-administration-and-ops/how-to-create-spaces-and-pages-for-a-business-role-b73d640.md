# How to Create Spaces and Pages for a Business Role



<a name="copyb73d64068e684e2ebf8598afb7d07ba9__HowToCreateSpacePage_context"/>

## Context

When creating a new business role, you can create a new launchpad space, use an existing launchpad space or launchpad spaces based on a predefined space. If required, you can add multiple spaces to the role by clicking *Add* on the *Assigned Launchpad Spaces* tab. If a launchpad space is no longer relevant for a role, you can click *Remove*. Please note that you can assign an existing launchpad space to several business roles at once. For more information, see the *Related Information* section.

> ### Note:  
> The group-based home page is deprecated. It will be removed in a future version. For new systems \(starting with SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2302\), the group-based home page is no longer available. It will be replaced with the spaces and pages mode. Therefore, a warning message is shown. It appears when you save a business role without an assigned space. It reminds you that you need to assign a space to make the tiles visible for the users when you have already switched to the spaces and pages mode.
