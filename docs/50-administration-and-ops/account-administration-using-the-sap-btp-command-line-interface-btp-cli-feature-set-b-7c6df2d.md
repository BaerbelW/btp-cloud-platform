# Account Administration Using the SAP BTP Command Line Interface \(btp CLI\) \[Feature Set B\]

Use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) for all account administration tasks, such as creating or updating subaccounts, authorization management, and working with service brokers and platforms. It is an alternative to the SAP BTP cockpit for all users who like to work in a terminal or want to automate operations using scripts.

The btp CLI offers convenient features for interactive use as well as for scripting: For the interactice user, there's login via SSO, command autocompletion, as well as several interactive commands with prompts. But all commands can also be run with parameters, so the btp CLI can just as well be used for scripting. In addition, there is the `--format JSON` option to receive the results as JSON instead of text, and it exposes exit codes for the result status. You can then use the capabilities of the shell, e.g. jq, to work with the results.

For a basic tutorial about automation with btp CLI, see [Automate Account Operations with the Command Line Interface](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cli-automate-operations.html).

> ### Note:  
> With the release of version 2.0.0 on March 25, 2021, the executable file of the CLI client was renamed from **sapcp** to **btp**. All commands remain compatible, and we will support the sapcp CLI until September 2021. However, this documentation and all examples inside refer to the **btp CLI**, and we recommend to download the latest btp CLI client from the [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud-btpcli) page. See [Migrating from sapcp to btp](migrating-from-sapcp-to-btp-4f1fe8d.md).

## How the btp CLI Works

 ![](images/Overview_of_CLI_for_SAP_BTP_3a71aa7.png) 

You download the btp CLI client to your local desktop and access it through the shell of your operating system. The client then accesses all required platform services through its backend, the CLI server, where the command definitions are stored. The CLI server delegates authentication and authorization to the authorization server, and forwards trust to the platform services, which then take care of authorization at the execution of each command.

## Setting up a Global Account via the Command Line

The btp CLI is an alternative to the SAP BTP cockpit that lets you carry out all account administration tasks on global account, directory, and subaccount level via the command line. If you go down the hierarchy starting with the global account, the last task in the btp CLI is to create environment instances \(for example, a Cloud Foundry org\). From here on, you need the cf CLI if you want to stay in the command line.

See the following workflows to learn how to set up a global account with the CLIs, see:
