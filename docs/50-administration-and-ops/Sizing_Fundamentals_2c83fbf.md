# Sizing Fundamentals

Sizing describes the process of translating business requirements into hardware requirements.

Sizing determines resource requirements such as CPU processing power, physical memory, as well as disk and network bandwidth. The outcome is influenced by both business and technological aspects. This means that the number of users and their application usage is as important as the behavior of the application and the underlying technology stack.
