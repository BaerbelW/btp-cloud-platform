## Context

The editing of an active business role takes place in a draft version of this business role. This draft version is created by the system once you enter the edit mode of the active business role. Proceed as follows to edit an active business role:

## Procedure

1.  Open the business role you need to edit.

2.  To enter the edit mode, click *Edit*.

    A draft version of the business role is created in which the editing takes place. The active business role remains.

3.  Make the required changes to the business role.

4.  Save the business role.

    Once the changes are saved, they are written into the active business role and the draft version disappears. **If the dialog for editing a business role is left without saving the business role**, the active business role as well as the draft version of the business role will be available in the business roles overview. In this case, you can continue editing the draft version later.
