# Commands in the btp CLI

A list of all tasks and respective commands that are available in the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\).

> ### Tip:  
> After login, all commands are executed in the global account. If you want to work in a specific subaccount or a directory, we recommend to set the target by using `btp target` \(see [Set a Target for Subsequent Commands with btp target](set-a-target-for-subsequent-commands-with-btp-target-720645a.md)\). Once you have done so, you do not have to pass the subaccount or directory parameter with every command, but it is taken from the context.

> ### Tip:  
> You can find extensive help about each command directly in the btp CLI. For example, use one of the following commands for help on `btp list accounts/subaccount`:
> 
> ```
> btp help list accounts/subaccount
> ```
> 
> ```
> btp --help list accounts/subaccount
> ```
> 
> ```
> btp list accounts/subaccount --help
> ```
