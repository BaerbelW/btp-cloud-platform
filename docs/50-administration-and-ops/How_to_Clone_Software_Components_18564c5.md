# How to Clone Software Components



<a name="loio18564c54f529496ba420d4c83545a2ce__section_q4w_4fj_1mb"/>

## Context

If a software component is not in your system yet, you will first need to clone it once to import it into your system.

> ### Note:  
> Cloning a software component is only necessary once per system instance.

## Procedure

1.  Go to the details page of the software component you would like to clone.

2.  Click *Clone*.

3.  A pop-up opens. You can now select which branch you would like to import. If the software component does not have branches yet, the master branch is automatically selected. Confirm by clicking *Clone*.

4.  The software component with the selected branch is now imported into your current system instance. The *Clone* button turns into a *Pull* button. From now on, you can use it to pull \(remotely available\) changes of your software component to your system.


> ### Note:  
> It is currently not possible to execute/trigger multiple actions \(clones/pulls/deletes\) in parallel on one system, regardless of the fact that the calls run asynchronously.
