# Message Monitoring \(Emergency Correction\)



With this app, you can edit non-customized fields of a message payload in an emergency.



## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Get a tabular overview of your interfaces and all messages \(with specific status\) processed through them.
-   Filter your overview by time and/or interface, and restrict it to show only interfaces with messages or errors.
-   Drill down on the messages of a specific interface and filter them by time, status, and key fields \(if any are defined\).
-   Get more information on an individual message, such as log messages, message details, and data structure.
-   Download the payload of a specific message.
-   Edit, restart, or cancel a message \(if in status *Error* or *In Process*\) \(this functionality is only available for selected message formats\).
-   Set process information for a message \(such as defining a process status\).
-   Identify interfaces with an active alert and confirm the alert.
-   Edit the payload of messages, even if the messages aren't customized to be changeable.

Despite having similar functionalities as *Message Monitoring for Integration Experts*, *Message Monitoring \(Emergency Correction\)* doesn't support navigating to the *Message Monitoring* app or performing mass error handling.
