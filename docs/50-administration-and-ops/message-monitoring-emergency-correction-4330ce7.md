# Message Monitoring \(Emergency Correction\)



With this app, you can edit non-customized fields of a message payload in an emergency.



## Key Features

-   Get a tabular overview of your interfaces and all messages \(with specific status\) processed through them.
-   Filter your overview by time and/or interface, and restruct it to show only interface with messages or errors.
-   Drill down on the messages of a specific interface and filter them by time, status, and key fields \(if any are defined\).
-   Get more information on an individual message, such as log messages, message details, and data structure.
-   Download the payload of a specific message.
-   Edit the payload of messages.

Despite having similar functionalities as *Message Monitoring for Integration Experts*, *Message Monitoring \(Emergency Correction\)* doesn't support navigating to the *Message Monitoring* app or performing mass error handling.
