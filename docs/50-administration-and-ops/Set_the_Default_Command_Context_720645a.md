# Set the Default Command Context

Change the default context for all command calls to the global account, a directory, or a subaccount by using the `btp target` command.



## Context

Targeting works along the hierarchy of your account model:

-   After login, the global account is targeted by default.

-   Commands that only work on a directory or global account level will be executed in the parent directory or global account of the current target.

-   When targeting a subaccount or directory, you can execute commands in its parent directory or global account by using '-dir' or '-ga' without a value.




## Procedure

1.  Use `btp target [PARAMS]` to set the context for subsequent commands.

    Usage: `btp [OPTIONS] target [PARAMS]`

    <table>
    <tr>
    <td>

    `--global-account, -ga` *<SUBDOMAIN\>*


    
    </td>
    <td>

    Only the global account of the active login can be targeted. As only one active login is possible, SUBDOMAIN can be omitted.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    `--directory, -dir`*<ID\>*


    
    </td>
    <td>

    The ID of the directory to be targeted. You can find the directory ID by running `btp get accounts/global-account --show-hierarchy`


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    `--subaccount, -sa` *<ID\>*


    
    </td>
    <td>

    The ID of the subaccount to be targeted. You can find this ID by running `btp list accounts/subaccount`.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    



<a name="loio720645a3ed3945bd8d97a670b948ac07__result_f5r_jms_w3b"/>

## Results

Once you have set the context to a subaccount, all subsequent commands are executed there, unless you specify a different one by providing one of the parameters directly in a command call.

> ### Tip:  
> To find out your current context, use `btp --info` or simply `btp`.



To set the context back to the global account, use `btp target -ga`.
