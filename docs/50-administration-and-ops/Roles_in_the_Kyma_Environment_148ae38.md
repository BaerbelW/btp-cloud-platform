# Roles in the Kyma Environment

Kyma uses roles and groups to manage access within the cluster.

After creating a Kyma cluster, you become an admin of this instance and the**KymaAdmin** role is assigned to you by default. As the **KymaAdmin** you can assign roles to users. You can assign roles to a group of users only if you use a custom identity provider. Assigning roles in Kyma is based on the Kubernetes RBAC concept. Kyma comes with a set of predefined roles. To learn more, read the [Authorization in Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/04-operation-guides/security/sec-02-authorization-in-kyma/) document.
