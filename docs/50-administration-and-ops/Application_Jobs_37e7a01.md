# Application Jobs

If you have manual activities that you often need to do at a specific time, the *Application Jobs* app can reduce your workload by running these tasks smoothly in the background. You can plan regular jobs which keeps you free to concentrate on other tasks.

-   Schedule jobs based on a job template: Select a job template, define the description, start date, start time and recurrence of the job, and enter job-specific selection criteria and parameters

-   Work with personalized job templates: Create and personalize a job template, save personalized job template for later use, and share personalized template

    > ### Note:  
    > The parameters under *Scheduling Information* cannot be saved as a part of a template.

-   Schedule jobs with a custom factory calendar: In the *Application Jobs* app, define the scheduling information, change an existing calendar, create a new one, and define execution days

-   Arrange job series that take different time zones into account

-   Monitor jobs

-   Display logs and results: You can navigate to job logs and job results by clicking on the icon in the *Log* or the*Results* column
