# Assign Recipients to Users



With this app you can assign your business users to the recipients that were defined for the communication scenarios. Once the users are assigned they can use the *Message Monitoring Overview* and *Message Dashboard* to monitor the interfaces and data messages they are responsible for.



## Key Features

-   Find and add users.

-   Find and assign pre-defined recipients to these users.

-   Define which types of log messages the user can see in the Message Dashboard, for example, warnings only.

-   Define if the messages are displayed or hidden on the Message Dashboard.

-   Define if the user can see messages that are in process or that had a technical error using *Advanced Error Handling*.

-   Unassign recipients from users.
