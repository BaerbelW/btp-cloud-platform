# Custom Code Analysis for SAP BTP: Configuration Guide

This guide describes how the SAP BTP ABAP environment needs to be configured and how a connection between SAP BTP and your on-premise system needs to be established to perform remote custom code analysis using the `Custom Code Migration` app.

The Custom Code Migration app in the SAP BTP ABAP environment can act as ABAP Test Cockpit \(ATC\), a central check system analyzing the ABAP source code located in your on-premise system. It enables you to identify functional or security vulnerabilities in your ABAP source code. This includes security checks performed by the SAP Code Vulnerability Analyzer \(CVA\).

In the following chapters, you will learn how to set up the `Custom Code Migration` app and your SAP BTP ABAP environment in order to perform an analysis, create a custom code analysis project, and, as a last step, analyze the findings.
