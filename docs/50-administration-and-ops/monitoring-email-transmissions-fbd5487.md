## Testmail Functionality

You can send out a test email to any recipient chosen by you. The subject and the text are fixed values that are set by the app. After the successful creation of the send requests, the email can be viewed in the main table of the *Monitor Email Transmissions* app.

Sending test emails can help administrators to check if the email outbound of their system is working. If the email outbound is not working, you'll either directly receive an error message, or you can see the error message in the main view of the *Monitor Email Transmissions* app.
