# Upload and Publish the Translated XLIFF File to the System



## Context

Your texts have been translated and a new XLIFF file has been sent back to you. You can now upload and publish the translated texts into the system. Hereâ€™s how:



## Procedure

1.  In the *Maintain Translations*app, open your project and scroll down to *Translations*.

2.  Select the entry for the source and target language for which you want to upload and publish the translated XLIFF file.

3.  Click *Upload*.

4.  Search for the translated file and confirm with *Upload*.

5.  Now the translations have been uploaded to the system. They still need to be published, however. Select the entry and click *Publish*.

6.  Select a transport to which you want to add the corresponding language \(LANG\) transport entries or R3TR TABU entries \(in case of text tables\) and click *Select*.

    Your translations have now been published.
