## SAP API Business Hub

The central repository for APIs from SAP and selected partners is the SAP API Business Hub. It contains reference documentation for a variety of REST and ODATA API packages that enable you to leverage the capabilities of SAP BTP.

For an overview of all API offerings for SAP BTP, see [SAP BTP on SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/themes/SAPCloudPlatformService?searchterm=&filter=(Type%20eq%20(API%20Package))).

If you're looking for information on APIs for a specific service, you can also use the [service catalog](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/viewServices) in the SAP Discovery Center. Click on a service tile to display the available information. If the service has APIs, you can find links to their documentation under *Resources*. You can also check if a service is available in your region by opening the *Service Plan* tab.
