# Setup of UI Development in SAP Web IDE \(Optional\)

If your developers want to use SAP Web IDE as a development tool for creating UIs, you as an administrator need to perform some additional settings.

If your developers want to use SAP Web IDE, which is part of the Neo environment, they need to work in the Cloud Foundry and the Neo environments. To enable an easier authentication of the developers in the Cloud Foundry and Neo environments, set up SAP BTP as a service provider, and Identity Authentication service as an identity provider. For the integration, you must set the trust on both sides and map the identity provider group for developers to its corresponding Neo group.

> ### Recommendation:  
> We recommend that you use SAP Business Application Studio as a UI development environment instead of SAP Web IDE.
