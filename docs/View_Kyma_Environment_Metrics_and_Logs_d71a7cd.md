# View Kyma Environment Metrics and Logs

In the Kyma environment, Grafana allows you to query, visualize, and explore metrics and logs collected for the Kyma components.

> ### Note:  
> You can view the data in the read-only mode. This means, you can browse predefined dashboards and query the data, but you cannot define or edit any configurations.

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) gives you access to the following views:

-   Predefined **dashboards** to visualize the data.
-   **Explore** to query logs and metrics.

> ### Caution:  
> There are limitations imposed on the amount of data that you can search at once in predefined dashboards and custom metrics in the **Explore** view. As a result, large queries that take over 30 seconds to retrieve data may get dropped.
