# Runtime Type Information

Implement the Runtime Type Services \(RTTS\) using a hierarchy of type description classes that contain the methods for Runtime Type Creation \(RTTC\) and Runtime Type Identification \(RTTI\).

Using these system classes, you can do the following:

-   Determine type information of existing instances and type names in the ABAP type system at runtime.

-   Define new data types at runtime.


For more information, see the ABAP Doc comments of class `CL_ABAP_TYPEDESCR` and its subclasses in the ABAP Development Tools \(ADT\).
