## Context

You can use the *Application Jobs* app to schedule and monitor application-related jobs. If you have manual activities that you often need to do at a specific time, the app can reduce your workload by running these tasks smoothly in the background. You can plan regular jobs which allows you to concentrate on other tasks.
