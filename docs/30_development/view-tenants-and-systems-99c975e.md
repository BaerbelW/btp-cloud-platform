## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the *Landscape Portal* and click on the tile *Systems Overview*.

2.  You can view a table listing all of your systems. You can see their lifecycle status, business type, and more.

3.  To get more information on one of the systems, click on that list entry. This will open the details view for that system.

4.  Scroll down to *Software* to see which software and which of your add-ons are currently installed in this system.

5.  Scroll down to *Tenants* to display a list of all tenants that are currently on this system, as well as their current lifecycle status, their business type and more. Via the client link you can login to the ABAP FLP of each of the clients. Prerequisite for access is a user in the tenant. For *Partner Customer Test* and *Partner Customer Production* tenants, request a support user in the *Landscape Portal*. For *Partner Test* tenants, the initial admin user is created during the test tenant creation. For *Partner Tenant* tenants, login using the initial administrator user created according to ABAP Solution service parameter provider\_admin\_email.
