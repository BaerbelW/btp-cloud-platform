## Java Options

You can configure the Java properties by defining the JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS environment variable.

Defining the JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS environment variable in the `manifest.yml` file of the application.

> ### Sample Code:  
> manifest.yml
> 
> ```
> ---
> applications:
> - name: <app-name>
>   memory: 512M
> ...
>   env:
>      JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS: '[from_environment: false, java_opts: ''-DtestJBPConfig=^%PATH^% -DtestJBPConfig1="test test" -DtestJBPConfig2="%PATH%"'']'
> ```

Defining the JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS environment variable by using the `cf set-env` command of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface \(cf CLI\).

```
cf set-env myapp JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS "[from_environment: false, java_opts: '-DtestJBPConfig=^%PATH^% -DtestJBPConfig1=\"test test\" -DtestJBPConfig2=\"^%PATH^%\"']"
```

## Escaping Strings



### When defining the JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS in the manifest.yml file

A single quote ['\] is used to enclose the JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS environment variable in the manifest.yml file. Strings containing the following characters must be quoted: [:\], [\{\], [\}\], [\[\], [\]\], [,\], [&\], [\*\], [\#\], [?\], [|\], [-\], [<\], [\>\], [=\], [!\], [%\], [@\], [\\\].

When a single quote ['\] is used, other single quotes ['\] in the string must be escaped by doubling it [''\].



### When defining the JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS by using the `cf set-env` command

The string must be enclosed in the double quotes ["\]. If there are other double quotes in the string, you have escape them using the backslash [\\\].



### When defining java options with values containing spaces

In case you need to specify a option value, which has blank spaces in it, you need to surround it with quotes ["\]. If the value contains special characters like for example [$\], you have to escape them using the escape character specific for the operating system shell where the application is pushed. In the example below the [$\] in the $PATH string is escaped using the [\\\] escape character for Linux. Otherwise, if the [$\] sign is not escaped, the value of the variable PATH is substituted in the property value.

> ### Sample Code:  
> manifest.yml
> 
> ```
>  ---
>  applications:
>  - name: <app-name>
>    memory: 512M
> ...
>    env:
>      JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS: '[from_environment: false, java_opts: ''-DtestJBPConfig=\$PATH -DtestJBPConfig1="test test" -DtestJBPConfig2="$PATH"'']'
> ```

## Java Memory Assistant \[AWS, Azure, or GCP Regions\]

> ### Note:  
> The content in this section is not relevant for China \(Shanghai\) and Government Cloud \(US\) regions.

A Java agent that generates heap dumps based on preconfigured conditions in the memory usage of the application. See [Java Memory Assistant](https://github.com/SAP/java-memory-assistant).

When enabled in the buildpack, the agent will generate two files â€“ `*.hprof` \(heap dump\) and `*.addons`, when the configured memory limits are met. The \*.addons file contains:

-   command line parameters

-   the implemented interfaces for the classes

-   information \(name\) about transient fields for the classes

-   a class and metaspace statistic

-   stack traces of the last OOM errors


See [Java Memory Assistant Framework](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/blob/master/docs/framework-java_memory_assistant.md).

## Java Out Of Memory Behavior

The SAP Java Buildpack prints a histogram of the heap to the logs, when the JVM encounters a terminal failure. In addition to that, if the application is bound to a volume service with name or tag that contains *heap-dump*, a heap dump file is also generated and stored in the mounted volume.

> ### Output Code:

This functionality is activated by default. It is possible to deactivate it by adding the `-XX:+ExitVMOnOutOfMemoryError` property \(through the `JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS` property\) in the application manifest file.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS: 'false, java_opts: ''-XX:+ExitVMOnOutOfMemoryError'''
> ```

## Using an Agent

You can use any agent with the SAP Java Build pack. The agent must be included in the `.jar` or `.war` archive of your application. The SAP Java Build pack extracts the agent when the application is deployed. You can check if the agent is extracted to the expected location by using the `cf ssh` command.

To use an agent with the SAP Java Build pack, set the *<JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS\>* environment variable as shown in the following example:

```
env:
    JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS: '[java_opts: "-javaagent:<PathToYourAgent>"]'
```

The Java agent is platform-agnostic, but must be compatible to the version of the JVM you are using.

You can also use a native agent. Since a native agent is a dynamic library, it must be compatible with the architecture of the platform. For Cloud Foundry, this is Linux x86\_64. As the application developer you must make sure that the correct agent is used and apply updates whenever they are needed. To use a native agent, set the *<JBP\_CONFIG\_JAVA\_OPTS\>* as follows:

```
 env:
    JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_OPTS: '[java_opts: "-agentpath:<PathToYourAgent>"]'
```

## SapMachine

[SapMachine](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/) is an alternative to SAP JVM. It provides a Java Runtime Environment \(JRE\) with Java 11, while SAP JVM provides a JRE with Java 8. It works only with the [Tomcat](application-containers-83d2416.md#loioddfc10180fe844049cc71f6989942dc2) and [Java Main](application-containers-83d2416.md#loio8a1786acd70445768b35e50f3038a2a9) application containers.



<a name="loio785d6b390b834bee818e242160f87df5__section_lly_ftm_33b"/>

## Activation

To activate SapMachine \(instead of using the default SAP JVM\) using the SAP Java Buildpack, you have to add the following environment variable:

```
---
applications:
- name: <app-name>
  ...
  env:
    JBP_CONFIG_COMPONENTS: "jres: ['com.sap.xs.java.buildpack.jdk.SAPMachineJDK']"
  ...
```
