# Print Forms

ADS Rendering in ABAP environment

The *Adobe Document Services* \(ADS\) can render Adobe XML Forms \(XFA\) to PDF documents and other print formats. The application sends the data and the form template using a secure connection and the service returns the rendered document. The rendered documents can be used by your applications for the screen output or for the output into the print queue. For more information, see [Maintain Print Queues](../50_administration_and_ops/maintain-print-queues-9dd6f64.md).
