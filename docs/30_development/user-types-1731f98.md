**Business users** are customer-owned end users that use SAP Fiori applications as well as applications and services in SAP BTP, such as SAP Business Application Studio. They are authorized by being assigned a specific business role. See [Create Business User](create-business-user-ef52a68.md).

> ### Note:  
> Developers using ABAP Development Tools are also considered business users.

**Communication users** are customer-owned technical users that are assigned to a communication system to enable integration with other solutions. For authentication, they can either be assigned a password or X.509 certificate. See [Communication User](communication-user-09a1ee0.md) and [Maintain Communication Users](../50_administration_and_ops/maintain-communication-users-eef80dd.md).

**Support users** are SAP-owned technical uses that can access customer systems. See [SAP Support User Request Log](../50_administration_and_ops/sap-support-user-request-log-934a027.md).
