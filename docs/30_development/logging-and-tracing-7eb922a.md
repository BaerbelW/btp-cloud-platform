# Logging and Tracing



<a name="loio7eb922a1668a435d8bd681263e0be12e__context_nwf_1vd_p2b"/>

## Context

SAP Java Buildpack integrates the [Cloud Foundry Java Logging Support](https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support) libraries, allowing applications to produce logs in the JSON format that can be parsed by the SAP Application Logging Service for SAP BTP.



## Procedure

1.  Bind the application to the SAP Application Logging service.

    To produce application logs and forward them to a central application logging stack, you must bind your application to the SAP Application Logging service.

2.  If you want to generate request metrics for applications using the Tomcat/TomEE application containers, add the *com.sap.hcp.cf.logging.servlet.filter.RequestLoggingFilter* filter to the `web.xml`.

    ```
    <filter-name>request-logging</filter-name>
       <filter-class>com.sap.hcp.cf.logging.servlet.filter.RequestLoggingFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
       <filter-name>request-logging</filter-name>
       <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > The default logging level of *com.sap.hcp.cf.logging.servlet.filter.RequestLoggingFilter* is set to *INFO*.

3.  Check the logs of the application.

    If the binding of your application to the SAP Application Logging service was successful, the application logs can be found on `https://logs.cf.<LANDSCAPENAME>`. You can use the `cf logs` command to request the logs.

    ```
    cf logs myapp --recent
    ```

4.  Change the logging level of a logging location.

    You can change the logging level of a specific location by setting the SET\_LOGGING\_LEVEL environment variable in the application's `manifest.yml` file.

    ```
    env:
      SET_LOGGING_LEVEL: '{com.sap.sample.java.LogInfo: INFO, com.sap.sample.java.LogWarn: WARN}'
    ```
