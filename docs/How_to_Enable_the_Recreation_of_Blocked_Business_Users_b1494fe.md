## Context

The system protects users in the blocking area from being recreated. The system prevents blocked business users from being recreated to prevent inconsistencies in the user data. You don't want the same business user associated with two different people. But there are cases where you want to recreate business users, which have been deleted. Perhaps a person who left your organization has come back.

> ### Note:  
> If you have the authorization to allow the recreation of users and you are recreating a blocked user, the recreation is automatically allowed.
