A redirect to the application router at a specific endpoint takes place during OAuth2 authentication with the service that you are using for the authentication \(User Account and Authentication service \(UAA\) or Identity Authentication service\).



This endpoint can be configured in order to avoid possible collisions, as illustrated in the following example:

> ### Sample Code:  
> Application Router “login” Property
> 
> ```
> "login": { 
>   "callbackEndpoint": "/custom/login/callback" 
> } 
> ```

> ### Tip:  
> The default endpoint is “`/login/callback`”.
