# Creating a Business Catalog

To make predefined authorizations for your business service available to administrators to use, create a business catalog.



## Context

In the business catalog, you can bundle multiple IAM apps and their predefined authorizations. You assign a business catalog to a business role. If you have more than one business catalog for the same business role, you might also consider creating a business role template.

Instead of creating a new business catalog, you can also reuse an existing business catalog for the app.



## Procedure

1.  To create a business catalog, follow the instructions of the ABAP development user guide: [Creating a Business Catalog](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/7e918e7975f542bdb2c9ae9105dccaba.html).

    Also follow the instructions to assign your IAM app to the business catalog.
