## Process Steps



This is a generic description about how to implement custom logic.

1.  To find a Cloud BAdI, open the *Custom Logic* app.
2.  Click   \(Create\)  . Select a BAdI Description of the delivered BAdI you want to implement. Add an implementation description and an implementation ID.
3.  Choose *Create*.
4.  Now you can modify and test the draft logic using ABAP for key users in a web-based editor. You can click on *Example* to see a sample implementation of the BAdI. Choose the fields for testing on the *Available Fields* tab, enter the test data and click *Test* to check if your custom logic is working as expected.

    > ### Note:  
    > Please make sure that any of your draft logic is syntactically correct and tested. Otherwise, the draft logic might be lost when your system is upgraded to another Cloud release.

5.  To activate your BAdI implementation, choose *Publish*.
