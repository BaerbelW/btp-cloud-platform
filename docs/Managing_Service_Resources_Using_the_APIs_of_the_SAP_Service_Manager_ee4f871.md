# Managing Service Resources Using the APIs of the SAP Service Manager

Use the APIs of the SAP Service Manager to work with environments, service brokers, service instances, service bindings, service plans, and service offerings.



SAP Service Manager is the central registry for service brokers and platforms in SAP BTP.

The service allows you to consume platform capabilities in any connected runtime environment, track the creation and managing of service instances, and share services and service instances between different environments.
