# Developing Authorizations for Business Users \(Developer\)

After youâ€™ve protected your service against unauthorized use, you can now create the objects that are needed to grant authorizations for business users: authorization default values, an IAM app, a business catalog, and a business role.

Follow the steps for editing authorization default values and for creating an IAM app, a business catalog, and a business role template.

> ### Note:  
> For developing authorizations for communication users, the procedure is different. For more information, see [Developing Authorizations for Communication Users \(Developer\)](Developing_Authorizations_for_Communication_Users_(Developer)_fadf4b5.md).
