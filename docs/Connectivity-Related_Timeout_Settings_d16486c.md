# Connectivity-Related Timeout Settings

The processing timeout for HTTP requests in the ABAP environment is 600 seconds. After this time period, requests are aborted.

> ### Note:  
> Request processing usually only takes a short amount of time during development because just small data sets are used. Make sure to keep the processing time also for production data set sizes.
