# How to Enable Read Access Logging



## Context

If you want to use Read Access Logging, you have to enable it. By default, Read Access Logging is disabled. You can change configurations for Read Access logging, even if Read Access logging is not enabled. But the logging is only done out when you have enabled it.



## Procedure

1.  In the app Read Access Logging Configuration, open *Enabling in Client*.

    A checkbox is displayed that shows if Read Access Logging is enabled.

2.  Choose *Edit*.

3.  To enable Read Access Logging, select the checkbox.

    If you want to disable Read Access Logging, deselect the checkbox.

4.  Save your settings.

## Results

You have enabled Read Access Logging. You can disable Read Access Logging at any time. For example, it might make sense to disable Read Access Logging temporarily when automated data processing is done at the end of a year. This would prevent the log from being filled unnecessarily. If only specific users need to excluded from logging, please refer to the chapter [How to Exclude Specific Users from Read Access Logging](How_to_Exclude_Specific_Users_from_Read_Access_Logging_9ee32b3.md).
