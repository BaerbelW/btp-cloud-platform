<a name="loioccb83c700e8d4bb8aa545d7307b8b08a__steps_uzh_p2d_crb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Get a global account.

    Sign up for a free trial account. See [Get a Free Trial Account](Getting_a_Global_Account_d61c281.md#loio42e7e54590424e65969fced1acd47694). For more information about the scope of our trial offering, see [Trial Accounts](../10-concepts/Trial_Accounts_046f127.md) .

2.  Set up your subaccount.

    When you register for a trial account, a subaccount is created for you. You can create more subaccounts to break down your account model and structure it according to your development scenario. But first it's important you understand how to navigate to your accounts using the SAP BTP cockpit.

    If you like, create further subaccounts. See [Create a Subaccount](../50-administration-and-ops/Create_a_Subaccount_05280a1.md). You can also download and use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to create new subaccounts. See [Download and Start Using the btp CLI Client](../50-administration-and-ops/Download_and_Start_Using_the_btp_CLI_Client_8a8f17f.md) and [Working with Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts Using the btp CLI](../50-administration-and-ops/Working_with_Global_Accounts,_Directories,_and_Subaccounts_Using_the_btp_CLI_85a683e.md).

3.  Enable and configure your Kyma environment.

    1.  In your subaccount view, select *Enable Kyma* and provide the required information. For details, see [Enable Trial Kyma Environment](Setting_Up_Your_Trial_Account_57074a0.md#loio6313afa84b8940f7963ceec0bb236780).

        > ### Note:  
        > If you canâ€™t see the *Enable Kyma* button in your subacccount view, make sure that your subaccount has entitlements for Kyma runtime configured. For more information, read [Managing Entitlements and Quotas Using the Cockpit](../50-administration-and-ops/Managing_Entitlements_and_Quotas_Using_the_Cockpit_c824874.md).


    1.  Now that you've set up your account model, it's time to think about member management. You can add members at different levels. For Kyma-specific role assignment, see [Assign Roles in the Kyma Environment](../50-administration-and-ops/Assign_Roles_in_the_Kyma_Environment_148ae38.md). You can also have a look at [User and Member Management](../10-concepts/User_and_Member_Management_cc1c676.md) to learn more about how user roles are assigned in SAP BTP.


4.  Develop applications and extend SAP solutions.

    Develop your application. Check out [Development in the Kyma Environment](../30-development/Development_in_the_Kyma_Environment_606ec61.md) to learn more about:
