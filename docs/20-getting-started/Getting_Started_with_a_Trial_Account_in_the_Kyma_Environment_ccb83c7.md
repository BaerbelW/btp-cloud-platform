## Procedure

1.  Get a global account.

    Sign up for a free trial account. See [Get a Free Trial Account](Getting_a_Global_Account_d61c281.md#loio42e7e54590424e65969fced1acd47694). For more information about the scope of our trial offering, see [Trial Accounts](../10-concepts/Trial_Accounts_046f127.md) .

    For more information on available plans, including free tier, see [Available Plans in the Kyma Environment](../50-administration-and-ops/Available_Plans_in_the_Kyma_Environment_befe01d.md).

2.  Set up your subaccount.

    When you register for a trial account, a subaccount is created for you.

    If you want to create more subaccounts to break down your account model and structure it according to your development scenario. see [Create a Subaccount](../50-administration-and-ops/Create_a_Subaccount_05280a1.md). But first it's important you understand how to navigate to your accounts using the SAP BTP cockpit.

    You can also download and use the SAP BTP command line interface \(btp CLI\) to create new subaccounts. See [Download and Start Using the btp CLI Client](../50-administration-and-ops/Download_and_Start_Using_the_btp_CLI_Client_8a8f17f.md) and [Working with Global Accounts, Directories, and Subaccounts Using the btp CLI](../50-administration-and-ops/Working_with_Global_Accounts,_Directories,_and_Subaccounts_Using_the_btp_CLI_85a683e.md).

3.  Create your Kyma environment. For details, see [Create the Kyma Environment Instance](../50-administration-and-ops/Create_the_Kyma_Environment_Instance_09dd313.md) and [Enable Trial Kyma Environment](Setting_Up_Your_Trial_Account_57074a0.md#loio6313afa84b8940f7963ceec0bb236780).

4.  Configure your Kyma environment.

    Now that you've set up your account model, it's time to think about member management. You can add members at different levels:

    -   For Kyma-specific role assignment, see [Assign Roles in the Kyma Environment](../50-administration-and-ops/Assign_Roles_in_the_Kyma_Environment_148ae38.md).

    -   To learn more about how user roles are assigned in SAP BTP, have a look at [User and Member Management](../10-concepts/User_and_Member_Management_cc1c676.md).


5.  Develop your applications and extend SAP solutions.
