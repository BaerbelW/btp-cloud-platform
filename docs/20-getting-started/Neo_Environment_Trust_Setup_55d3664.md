# Neo Environment: Trust Setup

To enable an easier authentication of the developers in the Cloud Foundry and Neo environments, set up SAP BTP as a service provider, and Identity Authentication service as an identity provider.

Before you follow the steps outlined here for setting up trust between the Neo application and the Identity Authentication service, make sure that you have already set up the Identity Authentication service as custom identity provider for the Cloud Foundry account. For more information, see [Setup of a Custom Identity Service \(Optional\)](Setup_of_a_Custom_Identity_Service_(Optional)_550251a.md).
