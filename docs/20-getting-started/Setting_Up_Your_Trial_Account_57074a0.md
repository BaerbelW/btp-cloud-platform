# Setting Up Your Trial Account

Your global trial account is set up automatically, so that you can start using it right away. However, if one or more of the automatic steps fail, you can also finalize the setup manually by following the steps below.

## Create Your Trial Subaccount

The first thing that is needed in the setup of your trial account is the creation of a subaccount. If this step was successful in the SAP BTP cockpit, you can directly skip to the next section.
