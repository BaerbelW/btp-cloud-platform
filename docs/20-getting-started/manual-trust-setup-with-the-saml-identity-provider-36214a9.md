## Process Overview

If you want to use Identity Authentication service as custom identity provider, you need to set up trust between the Cloud Foundry account and the Identity Authentication service.

You configure how the Cloud Foundry account, which acts as local service provider, communicates with the identity provider. This configuration includes, for example, setting a signing key and certificate to verify the service providerâ€™s identity and encrypt data. This configuration is later needed for developer authentication.
