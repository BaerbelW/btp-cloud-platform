## Context

An identity provider group for developers is useful, for example, if you want to assign a role collection to all developers in one step, such as the *Application\_Studio* role collection for SAP Business Application Studio.

You also use identity provider groups for developers if you want to assign all developers to a corresponding group in the Neo environment, which is necessary if your developers want to use SAP Web IDE as UI development tool.
