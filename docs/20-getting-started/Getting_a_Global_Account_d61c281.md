# Getting a Global Account

SAP BTP offers two types of global accounts: Trial accounts and enterprise accounts.

A **global account** is the realization of a contract you made with SAP. A global account is used to manage subaccounts, members, entitlements and quotas. You receive entitlements and quotas to use platform resources per global account and then distribute the entitlements and quotas to the subaccount for actual consumption. There are two types of global accounts: enterprise accounts \(paid\) and trial accounts \(free\).
