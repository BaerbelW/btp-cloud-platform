## Context and Use Cases

This configuration is needed for easier developer authentication using Identity Authentication service. With the creation of identity provider groups, you can also more easily map role collections to entire user groups instead of single users, or map identity provider groups to groups in the Neo environment, for example.

This documentation illustrates the basic concepts and helps you to get started with users and groups in a simple landscape for the ABAP environment.
