> ### Restriction:  
> Note that you can only select *Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)* as your provider and either *Europe \(Frankfurt\)* or *US East \(VA\)* as your region to get access to ABAP trial.

> ### Tip:  
> To speed up the setup process, log on to the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to your global trial account, and choose *Boosters* in the navigation area. The interactive booster *Prepare an Account for ABAP Trial* guides you through the process of creating an ABAP environment trial instance and a service key. To find out more about boosters, see [Boosters](../30-development/Boosters_fb1b561.md).
