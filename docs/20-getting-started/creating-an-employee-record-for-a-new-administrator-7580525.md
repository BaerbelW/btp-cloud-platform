To be able to create a new administration user, you first need to create an employee record for the new administrator.

## Prerequisites

You have logged on to the administration launchpad of the ABAP environment as administrator user \(see [Logging on to the Administration Launchpad of the ABAP Environment](logging-on-to-the-administration-launchpad-of-the-abap-environment-11e765e.md)\).



## Procedure

1.  From the SAP Fiori launchpad, open the *Maintain Employees* app.

2.  Choose *Create*.

3.  Enter the data for the new administrator, including employee ID, name, and e-mail address.

    The entered e-mail is important because it is the default approach to authorization and represents the mapping between the user in the identity provider and in the ABAP environment.

4.  Choose *Create*.
