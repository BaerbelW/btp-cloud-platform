# Implementing an Outbound Service Call to SAP S/4HANA Cloud

With the creation of the OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion destination to SAP S/4â€‹HANA Cloud, you have completed all administration activities needed to integrate SAP S/4HANA Cloud and the ABAP environment. The ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA Cloud are now set up for developers, who can now implement applications in the ABAP environment that call external services in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

The next steps of the developers would be the following:

1.  The developer downloads the service metadata from the business service in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

2.  The developer creates a client proxy from the metadata in the ABAP environment.

3.  The developer creates an HTTP service in the ABAP environment.

4.  The developer implements an outbound service call from the ABAP environment to the inbound service in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

5.  The business user opens the HTTP service in the ABAP environment.
