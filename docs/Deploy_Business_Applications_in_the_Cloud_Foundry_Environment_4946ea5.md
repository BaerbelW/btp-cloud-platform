# Deploy Business Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment

When an application for the Cloud Foundry environment resides in a folder on your local machine, you can deploy it and start it by executing the command line interface \(CLI\) command `push`. To deploy business applications bundled in a multitarget application archive, you have to use the command `deploy-mta`.

-   For more information developing Multitarget Applications, see [Multitarget Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](Multitarget_Applications_in_the_Cloud_Foundry_Environment_d04fc0e.md). See [Multitarget Application Commands for the Cloud Foundry Environment](Multitarget_Application_Commands_for_the_Cloud_Foundry_Environment_65ddb1b.md) for information about MTA deployment.
